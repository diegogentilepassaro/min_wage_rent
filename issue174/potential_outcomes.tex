\maketitle


Consider the causal model for rents given by
$$r_{it}=r_{it}(\{\mw_{zt}\}_{z\in\Z})$$
where $\mw_{zt}$ represents the log of the statutory MW, which we also
refer to as the ``dose'' of treatment received by unit $i$ from ZIP code $z$ 
in period $t$.
We think of $\Z$ as the ZIP codes in a closed metropolitan area.
Also, for simplicity we let $t\in\{1,2\}$.

\begin{definition}[Policy]\label{def:policy_change}
    In the first period, all locations are bound by a common MW level, 
    $\mw_{i1}=\mw$ for all $i$.
    In the second period, the MW increases to $\mw'>\mw$ in some 
    (directly treated) ZIP codes $i\in\Z_0\subset\Z$ for non-empty $\Z_0$.
    The MW levels in the second period are then 
    $\mw_{i2}=\mw$ for $i\notin\Z_0$ and
    $\mw_{i2}=\mw'$ for $i\in\Z_0$.
    We define the vectors $\mathbf{\mw}_1$ and $\mathbf{\mw}_2$ that collect
    treatment status for all units in each period.
\end{definition}

We want to learn the average effect of the policy, both directly and indirectly 
(through other units).

\begin{definition}[Average Treatment Effects]\label{def:ate}
    Consider the policy in Definition \ref{def:policy_change}.
    For any group of directly untreated ZIP codes $\Z_u\subseteq\Z\setminus\Z_0$,
    the indirect effect of the policy is given by
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:ate_wkp}
        \tau^{\wkp} = \frac{E\left[r_{i2}(\mathbf{\mw}_2)|i\in\Z_u\right] 
                          - E\left[r_{i2}(\mathbf{\mw}_1)|i\in\Z_u\right]}
                           {\mw'-\mw} .
    \end{equation}
    The direct effect of the policy is given by
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:ate_res}
        \tau^{\res} = \frac{E\left[r_{i2}(\mathbf{\mw}_2) 
                                 - r_{i2}(\mathbf{\mw}_1)|i\in\Z_0\right]}
                           {\mw'-\mw} .
    \end{equation}
\end{definition}

%% SH: To match the stacked model
Following Section 2, % \ref{sec:model}, 
we assume the following functional form for the causal model:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:causal_model}
    r_{it}(\mathbf{\mw}_{t})
           = \alpha_i + \hat\delta_t + \gamma \mw_{it}
           + \beta \sum_{z\in\Z} \pi_{iz} \mw_{zt}
           + \delta_t + \varepsilon_{it}
\end{equation}
where 
$\alpha_i$ is a unit fixed effect,
$\hat \delta_t$ is a time fixed effect, and
$\varepsilon_{it}$ is an error term.
We show that the treatment effects of interest are identified given this 
functional form.

\begin{prop}[Identification]\label{prop:did_id}
    Consider the policy in Definition \ref{def:policy_change} and the functional
    form in equation \eqref{eq:causal_model}.
    Assume
    (1) there exist at least two not directly treated ZIP codes with differential 
    exposure to the policy, 
    (2) parallel trends among two non-empty subgroups of not directly treated 
    ZIP codes (specified below),
    (3) parallel trends across directly treated ZIP codes and not directly 
    treated ZIP codes.
    Then, the average treatment effects in Definition \ref{def:ate} are 
    identified.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
    Rank ZIP codes $i\in\Z\setminus\Z_0$ based on their exposure to the policy 
    $\Pi_i = \sum_{z\in\Z_0}\pi_{iz}$.
    Let ZIP codes with $\Pi_i > \bar\Pi$ belong to a ``high exposure'' group $\Z_h\subset\Z\setminus\Z_0$, 
    and the rest to a ``low exposure'' group $\Z_l=\{\Z\setminus\Z_0\}\setminus\Z_h$,
    where $\bar\Pi\in\left(\min{\Pi_i}, \max{\Pi_i}\right)$.
    Given Assumption (1), such partition is always possible.
    We can write \eqref{eq:ate_wkp} as
    \[
    \begin{split}
        (\mw'-\mw) \tau^{\wkp}
            & = E\left[r_{i2}(\mathbf{\mw}_2) - r_{i2}(\mathbf{\mw}_1) | i\in\Z_h \right]
              + E\left[r_{i1}(\mathbf{\mw}_1) - r_{i1}(\mathbf{\mw}_1) | i\in\Z_l\right] \\
              & = E\left[r_{i2}(\mathbf{\mw}_2) | i\in\Z_h \right] 
                 - E\left[r_{i2}(\mathbf{\mw}_1) | i\in\Z_h \right]
                - E\left[r_{i2}(\mathbf{\mw}_1) - r_{i1}(\mathbf{\mw}_1) | i\in\Z_l\right] \\
    \end{split}
    \]

    The expected of rents in these groups is:
    \[
        r_{it}(\mathbf{\mw}_{t})
           = \alpha_i + \hat\delta_t + \gamma \mw_{it}
           + \beta \sum_{z\in\Z} \pi_{iz} \mw_{zt}
           + \delta_t + \varepsilon_{it}
    \]
    

\end{proof}
