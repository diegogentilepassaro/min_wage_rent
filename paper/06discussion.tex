TO ADD

% Calculation (SH): 

% Consider a zipcode that increases the hourly minimum wage from \$ 10 to \$ 11, and assume a household composed of two minimum wagers who work full time and pay \$ 2,500 of monthly rent. This family will experience an increase in their yearly income of approximately 2 $\times$ \$ 1 $\times$ 50 weeks $\times$ 40 hours a week $ = $ \$ 4,000.\footnote{Assuming they do not work for 2 weeks in a year.} According to our estimates, they would pay an extra \$ 2,500 $\times$ 12 $\times$ 0.5 $ = $ \$ 150 of rent.
