\begin{abstract}
    \noindent In this paper we estimate the effect of the minimum wage floors on 
    housing rental prices. Using data from Zillow and all minimum wage changes from 
    2010 to 2019 we construct a zipcode month dataset and we use the panel data literature 
    to identify our effect of interest by exploiting the precise timing and magnitude of 
    minimum wage changes across the US. We find that increasing the minimum wage 10\% 
    increases the average zipcode housing rental price between 0.25\% and 0.5\%. Importantly,
    this effect is driven by zipcodes with higher proportion of unemployed, African-American, 
    and low income households, where the magnitude of the estimates is consistently larger.
