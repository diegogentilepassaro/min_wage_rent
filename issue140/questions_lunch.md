## Introduction

- JMS: Didn't understand the claim that we are not aware of estimates of pass-through.
  If you think of income shocks to rents, there are papers.
  - DGP: We will compare our estimates with that literature.

- Bryce: Are you assuming something about who's income goes up with the MW.
  - DGP: On our empirical side we use different definitions of different groups.
  - Bryce: I would have started there.

- Pedro: surprised by how much the state border matters.

## Model

- JF: Thinks changes in the labor market are important
  - DGP: More clearly, we assume no disemployment effects
  - JF: So the MW generates a plain transfer
  - DGP: Yes

- Matt Turner: I think you are assuming people are locked in a residential location
  - JF: He is assuming that people are locked in residential and workplace
  - Bryce: It would be useful to have evidence on your assumptions

- Bobby: Evidence on prices adjusting faster than quantities. You could use that.

- Lorenzo: didn't hear

- Jon: Would point 3 be a problem if there were spillovers of MW. Your wage might go up even if you are not affected directly affected by it.
  - SH: We can probably think of modelling this.

- Bobby: We are assuming that people don't move, but are more people coming or what?
  - DGP: People can move within zip code and people can demand more footage

- JF: Do you need an i subscript on the f function? (equilibrium rents function)
  - Yes

- Jon: Likes the version of the model where we write the housing demand as a function
of prices and income.

- JF: In practice, MW workers are not in minimum wage families (young people). My intuition is that this is going to generate heterogeneity. How do you think is the homogeneity assumption?
  - DGP: That's an example that violates it.
  - SH: We can make the elasticity a function of zip code characteristics.
  - JF: One way of thinking about this is that this is an assumption motivated by the LODES data, which doesn't give breakdown between head of household and not.
  - JF: Another way to go is to impose homogeneity conditional on zip code observables.

- Bobby: Maybe you can exclude people who work in the same zip code. Only commuters should be more likely to be head of households // primary earners.

- Bryce: How do MW workers look like? That could help to understand what this is.

- Lorenzo: Again about public housing. Maybe you can use that variation.
  - DGP: We found some data.

- Bobby: Are there places that have less public housing? Might get to the above points.

## Data

- Bryce: Doesn't understand what SFCC means. Are apartments included?

- MT: What fraction of people living in those areas are low-wage workers. 

- Jon: Use calibration to get a sense of where mw workers are likely to be affected, based on income and rents.

- Bryce: Doesn't like the category.

- Jon: What fraction of workers in the US are at the min wage?

- Pedro: can use the analogous matrices

- Bryce: Less than $1251 per month?
  - Yes

## Empirical Strategy

- Jon: Is your measure incorporating how many people earn the MW? You should multiply by the share of people earning the MW.

- Jon: Idea on how to get share of MW workers from ACS.

- Jesse: you made homogeneity assumption. Maybe it's more plausible to state them in income. Representing the economics with different variables, the homogeneity may become more meaningful.

- Peter: In this model the assumption is that all units have the same potential trends. Might be useful to generalize, so that you only need parallel trends on average.

## Results

- JF: Wants to see the plot of Chicago with the actual data. Thinks you can do this non-parametrically
  - DGP: We'll send the figure
  - JF: You should be able to do more to show the boundary

- Jon: You are really comparing the one zip code you have in chicago to some zip code in houston. You could do more to pin down what comparisons you make.

- Santi Perez: Question about the data. I missed it.

## Counterfactuals

- Jon: You could relax the assumption that epsilon is homogeneous.
  - DGP: We got an estimate in line to the literature
  - Bryce: If you multiply by the number of people affected your estimate is too big
  - DGP: Thanks, we can improve
