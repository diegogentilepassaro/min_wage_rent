In this note we lay down the main theoretical framework and empirical strategy
 for the project.
 We lay down a few questions related to the latter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Theoretical Framework
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We are interested in the short-run effects of increases in minimum wages
 on a ZIP code's rental market.
 Residents in this ZIP code potentially work in some other ZIP code, under
 a different minimum wage policy.
 We let 
\begin_inset Formula $z\in\mathcal{Z}_{i}$
\end_inset

 be workplaces of residents of 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{w}_{i}$
\end_inset

 be the MW binding at ZIP code 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula ${\underline{w}_{z}}_{z\in\mathcal{Z}_{i}}$
\end_inset

 the ones binding at each workplace.
 Residents of 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 meet in a single market to rent square feet, with equilibrium rents per
 square foot 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}$
\end_inset

 given by
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sum_{z\in\mathcal{Z}_{i}}L_{iz}h_{iz}(r_{i},p_{i},y_{z})=D_{i}(r_{i}),
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{z}$
\end_inset

 are prices of local consumption goods, and income of people working in
 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula ${L_{iz}}_{z\in\mathcal{Z}_{i}}$
\end_inset

 are (exogenous) measures of workers commuting to 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $L_{i}=\sum_{z\in\mathcal{Z}_{i}}L_{iz}$
\end_inset

 are 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

's residents), and 
\begin_inset Formula ${h_{iz}(\cdot)}_{z\in\mathcal{Z}_{i}}$
\end_inset

 are housing demand functions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Under the assumption that 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}=p_{i}(\underline{w}_{i})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{z}=y_{z}(\underline{w}_{z})$
\end_inset

, both increasing, we can use the equilibrium condition to write a change
 in the log of rents as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
d\ln r_{i}=\gamma_{i}d\ln\underline{w}_{i}+\beta_{i}\sum_{z\in\mathcal{Z}_{i}}\pi_{iz}d\ln\underline{w}_{z}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{i}$
\end_inset

 are parameters that depend on elasticities, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{iz}=L_{iz}/L_{i}$
\end_inset

 are commuting shares.
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We also need to assume that the elasticity of housing demand to income doesn't
 vary by 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

,
\end_layout

\end_inset

 It turns out that, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial h_{iz}/\partial p_{i}<0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial h_{iz}/\partial y_{z}>0$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{i}<0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{i}>0$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a result of this exercise, we expect workplace and residence MW changes
 to have opposing effects on rental prices.

\begin_layout Section*
Empirical Approach
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We are interested in models of the form
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\ln r_{it}=\alpha_{i}+\tilde{\delta}_{t}+\gamma\ln\underline{w}_{it}+\beta\underline{w}_{it}^{exp}+\epsilon_{it}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 is ZIP code and 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 is monthly data.
 We sometimes include time-varying covariates or allow time effects to vary
 by some wider geography (state, CBSA).
 Taking first differences, we get
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Delta\ln r_{it}=\delta_{t}+\gamma\Delta\ln\underline{w}_{it}+\beta\Delta\underline{w}_{it}^{exp}+\Delta\epsilon_{it}\label{eq:fd_model}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{t}=\tilde{\delta}_{t}-\tilde{\delta}_{t-1}.$
\end_inset

 We use a first-differences specification because we expect the unobserved
 shocks in the levels equation to be positively correlated over time.
 Furtermore, we detected strong correlation of local rents over time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We estimate this model under an unbalanced, partially balanced and fully
 balanced panels of the Zillow rents data and we consistently obtain negative
 estimates for 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 and positive ones for 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

.

Results without the controls look very similar.

 When extending the model to add leads and lags of the MW variables we obtain
 coefficients that are statistically equal to zero for both, while 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 remain very similar.

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, after converging a model that we trust, we plan to compute ZIP
 code-specific MW-to-rents pass-through coefficients for a counterfactual
 increase in the federal minimum wage (using ZIP code-year IRS data to estimate
 the elasticity of income to the minimum wage).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because we are dealing with a staggered continuous treatment that spills
 over across metropolitan areas, it is not entirely obvious whether our
 estimation strategy is actually computing what we want.
 Our questions are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Does the differenced estimator from 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:fd_model"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 correctly identifies the parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 from an underlying causal model? The main complication we note is that,
 in each event, this estimator compares units that are treated directly,
 some that are treated indirectly, some that are not treated, and some that
 were treated before but had no MW change recently.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
To deal with the issues generated by the staggered nature of out treatment,
 should we implement an alternative estimation approach where we restrict
 the units that we use as controls for each treatment? Treatment effect
 heterogeneity or dynamic effects might potentially bias our estimates.
 As we are interested in two variables (the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

residence
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

workplace
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 MWs) it is not obvious what is the best way to define cleanly the control
 units.
 We thought of (i) a stacking method as in Cegniz et al (2019), (ii) using
 the imputation method in Borusyak et al (2021).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Should we think of this problem as estimation of the effect of same-unit
 MW controlling for spillovers across units (e.g., Butts 2021)? However, we
 find it more appealing from an economic theory perspective to estimate
 the effect of both workplace and residence MW changes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Should we more seriously try to map the theoretical model to the empirical
 one? We could develop a microfoundation starting from a worker's utility
 similar to Madera et al (2021).
 A shortcoming is that the theoretical model assumes people only consume
 in their residence ZIP code, which is clearly not true.
 One could even think of a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

consumption MW
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which would average minimum wage levels using shares of non-tradable consumptio
n in every other ZIP code.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To illustrate our initial thinking, in the appendix we lay out a formal
 causal model in which we discuss identification of both 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 for a 3 units example.

Appendix: Identification with continouos treatment and spillovers across
 units
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider the causal model for rents given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
r_{it}=Y_{it}\left(\{w_{zt}\}_{z\in\mathcal{Z}}\right)
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{zt}$
\end_inset

 gives the treatment ZIP code 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 receives from ZIP code 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{Z}$
\end_inset

 is the total number of units.
 We impose some structure by assuming that
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Y_{it}(w_{1t},...,w_{it})=\alpha_{i}+\delta_{t}+\gamma w_{it}+\beta\sum_{z\in\mathcal{Z}}\pi_{iz}w_{zt}+u_{it}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{t}$
\end_inset

 are fixed effects, 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{iz}\in[0,1]$
\end_inset

 is the (fixed) share of 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 residents that work in 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

, known to the econometrician, 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{it}$
\end_inset

 is an unobserved shock, 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma,\beta\in\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 are scalar parameters.
 Note that this model assumes a direct effect of treatment equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma+\beta\pi_{ii}$
\end_inset

 and the effect of treatment somewhere else equals 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta\pi_{iz}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
A simple example with 3 ZIP codes and 2 time periods
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider a hypothetical metropolitan area with 3 ZIP codes and two consecutive
 periods (period 0 and 1), such that 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{it}=Y_{it}(w_{1t},w_{2t},w_{3t})$
\end_inset

.
 Suppose that in period 0 the MW is $0 everywhere, but in period 1 the MW
 in unit 2 increases to 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{21}=\$1$
\end_inset

.
 Then, we have the following data:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{10}(0,0,0)=\alpha_{1}+\delta_{0}+u_{10}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{11}(0,1,0)=\alpha_{1}+\delta_{1}+\beta\pi_{12}+u_{11}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{20}(0,0,0)=\alpha_{2}+\delta_{0}+u_{20}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{21}(0,1,0)=\alpha_{2}+\delta_{1}+\gamma+\beta\pi_{22}+u_{21}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\Delta Y_{i}=Y_{i1}-Y_{i0}$

 ,

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta=\delta_{1}-\delta_{0},$
\end_inset

 we have
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta Y_{1}=\delta+\beta\pi_{12}+\Delta u_{1}$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta Y_{2}=\delta+\gamma+\beta\pi_{22}+\Delta u_{2}$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
Can we identify 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

? Differencing units 3 and 1 we obtain
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\beta=\frac{\Delta Y_{3}-\Delta Y_{1}+\Delta u_{3}-\Delta u_{1}}{\pi_{32}-\pi_{12}}
\]

\end_inset

so to compute 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 from observed data we need that
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Delta u_{3}-\Delta u_{1}=0.\label{eq:par_trends_1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

This condition can be interpreted as a paralell trends assumption between
 the indirectly treated units.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using units 1 and 2 to solve for 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 we have that
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\begin{split}\gamma & =\Delta Y_{2}-\Delta Y_{1}-\beta(\pi_{22}-\pi_{12})-\Delta u_{2}+\Delta u_{1}\\
 & =\Delta Y_{2}-\Delta Y_{1}-\left[\frac{\Delta Y_{1}-\Delta Y_{3}}{\pi_{32}-\pi_{12}}\right](\pi_{22}-\pi_{12})-\Delta u_{2}+\Delta u_{1}\\
 & =\Delta Y_{2}-\left[\frac{\pi_{32}-\pi_{22}}{\pi_{32}-\pi_{12}}\Delta Y_{1}+\frac{\pi_{12}-\pi_{22}}{\pi_{32}-\pi_{12}}\Delta Y_{3}\right]-\Delta u_{2}+\Delta u_{1}
\end{split}
\]

\end_inset

so to compute 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 from observed data we need a similar parallel trends assumption between
 directly and indirectly treated units, namely,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
-\Delta u_{2}+\Delta u_{1}=0.\label{eq:par_trends_2}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
Equations 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:par_trends_2"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 imply that unobservables should evolve in parallel for all units, i.e.,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
(u_{11}-u_{10})=(u_{21}-u_{20})=(u_{31}-u_{30}).
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once we are armed with the parallel trends assumptions, the workplace MW
 parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 is identified off of a difference-in-differences between units that are
 not treated directly, adjusted by their difference in exposure to the treatment
 arising in unit 2.
 Interestingly, no 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

never treated
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 units are required for identification.
 Note that we need to assume 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{32}-\pi_{12}\neq0$
\end_inset

.
 If this is not the case 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 is not identified from the comparison of untreated units.
 Intuitively, if there is no variation in exposure among the indirectly
 treated units we cannot get identification even in the presence of paralell
 trends.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The residence MW parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 is identified by substracting from the unit 2 difference a linear combination
 of the difference in indirectly treated units, where the constants reflect
 the relative difference of exposure to unit 2's treatment.
 For instance, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{22}>\pi_{32}>\pi_{12}$
\end_inset

 so both units 1 and 3 are 
\emph on
less
\emph default
 exposed indirectly than unit 3, then both 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta Y_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta Y_{3}$
\end_inset

 will have a negative coefficient.
 On the other hand, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{32}>\pi_{12}>\pi_{22}$
\end_inset

 and units 1 and 3 are 
\emph on
more
\emph default
 exposed than unit 2, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta Y_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta Y_{3}$
\end_inset

 will have a possitive coefficient.
 If the indirectly treated units are exposed more than unit 2, then we'll
 be performing a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

addition-in-differences.
