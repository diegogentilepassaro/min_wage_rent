%%% Introduction %%%

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Motivation}
	
	Research on minimum wage (MW) has mostly focused on labor market outcomes.
	% States: people work and reside under same MW.
	
	\vspace{1.5mm}

	However, as MW policies are \textit{place-based}, one should expect broader effects 
	in the local economy
	\begin{enumerate}[$\Rightarrow $]
		\item Housing market.
	\end{enumerate}

	\pause
	\vspace{3mm}
	\textbf{Prediction from theory}
	
    A canonical version of the (Muth-Mills) monocentric city model suggests that income increases will 
    pass-through 1:1 to rents \parencite{Brueckner1987}.  
    \begin{enumerate}[$\Rightarrow $]
		\item We are not aware of empirical estimates of that pass-through!
	\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{This paper}
	We investigate the short term effects of MW policies on rents in the US:
	\begin{itemize}
		\vspace{.5mm} \item Accounting for spatial spillovers, we estimate 
		the elasticity of median market rents to workplace and residence MWs.
		\vspace{.5mm} \item Estimate the share on the extra dollar generated by
		MW increases accruing to landlords.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\vspace{3mm}
	\pause
	To do so, we:
	\begin{itemize}
    	\vspace{.5mm} \item Exploit high-frequency (monthly) high-resolution 
    	(ZIP Code) rents data from Zillow.
    	\vspace{.5mm} \item Leverage timing and spatial variation in MW changes 
    	\textit{within} metropolitan areas.
    	\vspace{.5mm} \item Propose a novel model-based measure of exposure to MW 
		changes based on commuting shares.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{An initial intuition}
    
    \vspace{3mm}
    
	Think of a metropolitan area and a MW increase in the business district (CBD). 
	
	\vspace{3mm}
	
    \textbf{Partial equilibrium: short term}
	\begin{itemize}
		\vspace{.5mm} \item Firms producing in the CBD will pay a higher wage. Income 
		redistribution from CBD consumers to low-income workers.
		\vspace{.5mm} \item Income changes are heterogeneous across space because people work 
		and reside in different locations.
		\vspace{.5mm} \item Housing is a normal good, so demand in some areas increases 
		and landlords charge a higher rent.
	\end{itemize}

	\pause
	\vspace{3mm}
	\textbf{General equilibrium: long term} (Not this paper!)
	\begin{itemize}
	\vspace{.5mm} \item People change residence and workplace locations (sorting).
	\vspace{.5mm} \item Developers build more houses (supply response).
\end{itemize}

\section{A Partial Equilibrium Model of Local Rental Markets}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Overview}
    
    Goals of the model:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Stylized answer to: what is the short-term effect of MW changes in rent prices?
		\item Motivate and derive a new measure of exposure to MW.
		\item Emphasize why residence and workerplace MWs may have different effects on the housing market.
		\item Motivate empirical strategy: use commuting patterns to account for spatial spillovers of MW policies.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\pause
	\vspace{2mm}
	The model is \textit{not} intended to:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Describe within-city residential sorting.
		\item Describe local labor or goods markets.
		\item Perform general equilibrium welfare analysis of MW policies.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Setup}
    
    Static rental market of some ZIP code $i$ embedded in a larger geography with finite
	set of ZIP codes $\Z$.    
    \begin{itemize}
		\vspace{2mm}
		\item Workers with residence $i$ may work in some other ZIP code $z\in\Z(i)\subseteq\Z$.

		\pause
		\vspace{2mm}
		\item Exogenous and fixed measure of $i$'s residents who work in $z$, $L_{iz}$.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Residents in $i$: $L_i = \sum_{z \in \Z(i)} L_{iz}$.
			\item Workers in $z$: $L_z = \sum_{i \in \Z(i)} L_{iz}$.
		\end{itemize}
	
		\pause
		\vspace{2mm}
		\item Binding minimum wages: $\{\MW_i\}_{i\in\Z}$.
		
		\pause
		\vspace{2mm}
		\item $h_{i z} (R_i, \MW_i, \MW_z)$: housing demand of $i$'s residents that work in $z$, where $R_i$ 
		represents housing rents per square foot.

		\pause
		\vspace{2mm}
		\item $S_i \left(R_i \right)$: supply of square feet in $i$, which is increasing in $R_i$.

	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Housing demand functions}
   
	\begin{assu}[Housing demand]\label{assu:housing_function}
		For all residence-workplace pairs, the housing demand functions $h_{iz} (R_i, \MW_i, \MW_z)$ is
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item continuously differentiable in its three arguments;
			\item decreasing in rental prices $R_i$;
			\item non-decreasing in workplace minimum wage $\MW_z$;
			\item non-increasing in residence minimum wage $\MW_i$.
		\end{enumerate}
		Furthermore, for at least one $z\in\Z(i)$, the inequalities in points (3)
		and (4) are strict.
	\end{assu}

	\pause 
	\vspace{2mm}

	\textbf{In words:} conditional on workplace MWs, residence MW may negatively affect disposable income
	and thus demand for housing.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[label = discuss4]
    \frametitle{Discussion on assumption 4}

	Evidence suggests that MW changes affect prices of local consumption
    \begin{itemize}
		\vspace{1mm}
        \item \textcite{MiyauchiEtAl2021} shows that individuals tend to consume close to home and that 
        they are aware of price differentials across neighborhoods.
		\vspace{1mm}
        \item MWs have been shown to increase prices of local consumption 
        \parencite[e.g.,][]{AllegrettoReich2018, Leung2021}.
    \end{itemize}

    \pause 
    \vspace{2mm}

    Will MW changes also affect housing demand? Consider an increase in residence MW:
    \begin{itemize}
		\vspace{1mm}
        \item If non-tradable goods use low-wage work as input, then local prices will increase.
		\vspace{1mm}
		\item Housing demand will fall if substitution effect is smaller than income effect.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Sufficient condition: housing and local consumption are complements.
		\end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

	Formalizing these ideas: \hyperlink{microfound}{\beamerbutton{Microfoundation}}  
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Equilibrium}
	
	Define the housing demand in ZIP code $i$ as:
	
	 \[
	 H_{i} (R_i, \{\MW_z\}_{z\in\Z(i)}) = \sum_{z\in\Z(i)} L_{iz} h_{iz} (R_i, \MW_i, \MW_z)
	 \]
	
	The rental market of ZIP code $i$ is in equilibrium if
	
	$$ H_{i} (R_i, \{\MW_z\}_{z\in\Z(i)}) = S_i(R_i) $$
	
    Under suitable regularity conditions, the unique equilibrium is 
	$$R^*_i = f(\{\MW_i\}_{i\in\Z(i)})$$
	
	\vspace{3mm}
	\pause
	We are interested in the effects of MW policies on rents.
	\vspace{1mm}
	\begin{itemize} \small
		\item What is the effect of a change in the vector of MWs 
		$(\{d \MW_i\}_{i\in\Z(i)})'$ on equilibrium rents?
		\item Under what conditions can we represent those effects in a simpler way?
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[label = prop_comp_stat]
    \frametitle{Comparative Statics}
    
    \begin{prop}[Comparative Statics]\label{prop:comparative_statics}
        Under the assumptions of
        \begin{enumerate}
           \item fixed number of workers across workplace and residence pairs;
           \item housing demand equation satisfying conditions above; 
           \item continuously differentiable and increasing housing supply.
        \end{enumerate} 
        We have that
        \begin{itemize}
            \item workplace-MW hikes increase rents;
            \item holding constant workplace-MW hikes, residence-MW hikes decrease rents.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{prop}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[label = proof_comp_stat]
\frametitle{Proof of Proposition (Comparative Statics)}

    Fully differentiate the market clearing condition with respect to $\ln R_i$ and 
    $\ln \MW_i$ for all $i\in\Z(i)$ and re-arrange terms to get:
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:diff_equilibrium}
        \Big(\eta_i - \sum_z \pi_{iz} \xi_{iz} \Big) d \ln R_i
        = 
        \sum_z \pi_{iz} \left(\epsilon_{iz}^i d \ln \MW_i 
                            + \epsilon_{iz}^z d \ln \MW_z \right) ,
    \end{equation}
    where:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\eta_i = \frac{1}{L_i} \frac{d S_i}{d R_i} \frac{R_i}{S_i}$ is the per resident elasticity 
        of housing supply in $i$
        \item Commuter shares: $\pi_{iz} = \frac{L_{iz}}{L_i}$
        \item $\xi_{iz} = \frac{d h_{iz}}{d R_i} \frac{R_i}{\sum_z \pi_{iz} h_{iz}}$ is the 
        elasticity of housing demand to rents at average per-capita demand of $i$
        \item  $\epsilon_{iz}^i = \frac{d h_{iz}}{d \MW_i} \frac{\MW_i}{\sum_z \pi_{iz} h_{iz}}$ and 
        $\epsilon_{iz}^z = \frac{d h_{iz}}{d \MW_z} \frac{\MW_z}{\sum_z \pi_{iz} h_{iz}}$ 
        are the elasticities of housing demand to workplace and residence MWs also at
         the average per-capita demand of $i$
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Proof of Proposition (Comparative Statics) (continuation)}
    
    Using assumption on housing demand we have that
    $$
	\xi_{iz} < 0, \quad\quad\quad \epsilon_{iz}^i < 0, \quad\quad\quad \epsilon_{iz}^z > 0 .
	$$
	\vspace{1mm}
    Therefore, it follows from \eqref{eq:diff_equilibrium} that
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item an increase in workplace MW unambiguously increases rents;
        \item an increase in residence MW on rents is generally ambiguous 
        (as long as some residents of $i$ also work in $i$) as it is composed of a direct negative 
        effect and an indirect positive effect through workplace MW;\footnote{The sign of the overall partial effect depends on the sign of 
    $\pi_{ii} \epsilon_{ii}^z + \sum_z \pi_{iz} \epsilon_{iz}^i$.}
        \item Holding constant workplace MWs, the effect of the residence MW is negative.
    \end{enumerate}    
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[label = representation_prop]
    \frametitle{Simplifying the equilibrium rents function}
    
	\begin{prop}[Representation]\label{prop:representation}
		Under the assumption of constant elasticity of housing demand (across workplace locations)
		to workplace minimum wages we have that:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item We can write the change in \textbf{log rents} as a function of the change in two 
			MW-based measures: the \textbf{workplace log MW} and the \textbf{residence log MW}.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{prop}

	\pause
	\vspace{2mm}

	\begin{proof}
		Set $\epsilon_{iz}^z = \epsilon_i^z$ for all $z\in\Z(i)$ 
		we can manipulate \eqref{eq:diff_equilibrium} to write:
		\begin{equation} \label{eq:theory_represenation}
			\underbrace{d \ln R_i}_{dr_i} 
			    = \beta_i \underbrace{\sum_i \pi_{iz} d\ln \MW_z}_{d\MW^{\text{wrk}}_{i}}
				+ \gamma_i \underbrace{d \ln \MW_i}_{d\MW^{\text{res}}_{i}}
		\end{equation}
		where $\beta_i = \frac{\epsilon_{i}^z}{\eta_{i} - \sum_z \pi_{iz} \xi_{iz}}$ 
		and $\gamma_i = \frac{\sum_z \pi_{iz} \epsilon_{iz}^i}{\eta_{i} - \sum_z \pi_{iz} \xi_{iz}}$.
	\end{proof}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Motivating our empirical strategy}
	We have that the theoretical partial equilibrium effect of a change in elements of a vector of MW on rents is given by:
		\begin{equation}
				d r_i = \beta_i d \MW^{\text{wrk}}_{i}+ \gamma_i d \MW^{\text{res}}_i
			\end{equation}
			
	Where, because of Proposition (Comparative Statics), we have that:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The partial effect of workplace MW, $\beta_i = \frac{\epsilon_{i}^z}{\eta_{i} - \sum_z \pi_{iz} \xi_{iz}} > 0$;
		\item The partial effect of residence MW, $\gamma_i = \frac{\sum_z \pi_{iz} \epsilon_{iz}^i}{\eta_{i} 
				- \sum_z \pi_{iz} \xi_{iz}} < 0$.
	\end{itemize}

	\pause
	\vspace{2mm}
	Today, we will estimate an empirical analog assuming homogenous effects across 
	locations.

	Consider the potential outcomes model for log rents given by:

	\textbf{Questions:}

		\item Are $\beta$ and $\gamma$ identified? 
		\item Through which comparisons?

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{A simple example with 3 ZIP Codes and 2 time periods}

	Consider a hypothetical metropolitan area
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 3 ZIP Codes and 2 consecutive periods (periods 0 and 1)
		\item In $t=0$ the MW is \$0 everywhere, but in $t=1$ the MW in unit 2 increases to \$1
	\end{itemize}

	\pause 
	\vspace{2mm}
	We have have 6 observations for rents, and the potential outcomes model implies:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $r_{10}(0,0,0)=\alpha_{1}+\delta_{0}+u_{10}$
		\item $r_{11}(0,1,0)=\alpha_{1}+\delta_{1}+\beta\pi_{12}+u_{11}$
		\item $r_{20}(0,0,0)=\alpha_{2}+\delta_{0}+u_{20}$
		\item $r_{21}(0,1,0)=\alpha_{2}+\delta_{1}+\gamma+\beta\pi_{22}+u_{21}$
		\item $r_{30}(0,0,0)=\alpha_{3}+\delta_{0}+u_{30}$
		\item $r_{31}(0,1,0)=\alpha_{3}+\delta_{1}+\beta\pi_{32}+u_{31}$
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Solving for $\beta$}

	Taking time differences, and denoting $\Delta x_i = x_{i1} - r_{i0}$ and $\delta = \delta_{1} - \delta_{0}$ we have that:

	\begin{itemize}
		\item $\Delta r_{1} = \delta + \beta\pi_{12} + \Delta u_{1}f$
		\item $\Delta r_{2} = \delta + \gamma + \beta\pi_{22} + \Delta u_{2}$
		\item $\Delta r_{3} = \delta + \beta\pi_{32} + \Delta u_{3}$
	\end{itemize}

	\pause
	\vspace{2mm}

	Now differentiate the indirectly treated units and rearrange to obtain:
	\[
	\beta = \frac{(\Delta r_{3} - \Delta r_{1}) + (\Delta u_{3} - \Delta u_{1})}{\pi_{32} - \pi_{12}}
	\]

	\vspace{2mm}
	To identify $\beta$ we need:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item parallel trends across indirectly treated units: $\Delta u_{3} - \Delta u_{1} = 0$
		\item variation in exposure across indirectly treated units:  $\pi_{32} - \pi_{12} \neq 0$
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Solving for $\gamma$}

	Differentiate the treated unit with an indirectly treated unit and rearrange to obtain:
	\[
	\begin{split}
	\gamma & = \Delta r_{2} - \Delta r_{1} - \beta(\pi_{22} - \pi_{12}) + (\Delta u_{2} - \Delta u_{1}) \\
		& = \Delta r_{2} - \left[\frac{\pi_{32} - \pi_{22}}{\pi_{32} - \pi_{12}}\Delta r_{1} + \frac{\pi_{12} - 
		\pi_{22}}{\pi_{32} - \pi_{12}}\Delta r_{3}\right] + (\Delta u_{2} - \Delta u_{1})
	\end{split}
	\]

	\vspace{2mm}
	To additionally identify $\gamma$ we need
	\begin{itemize}
		\item parallel trends across treated and indirectly treated units: $\Delta u_{2} - \Delta u_{1} = 0$
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Interpretation}

	\vspace{2mm}

	\begin{itemize}
		\vspace{2mm}\item We need parallel trends across treated and indirectly treated groups. 
		\vspace{2mm}\item Interestingly, with continuous treatment and an assumption of how spillovers are dosed, 
		we don't need pure control control units, as we can make contrasts of units with different exposure levels. 
		\vspace{2mm}\item $\beta$ can be thought of a difference-in-differences between indirectly treated units
		adjusted by their difference in exposure to the treated units. 
		\vspace{2mm}\item $\gamma$ is identified by a difference-in-differences in which we difference the treated units with a linear combination 
		of the difference in indirectly treated units, where the coefficients reflect the relative difference of exposure to treated units.

    	\item Other nearby ZIP codes are affected only through workplace
    \end{itemize}
    
    \pause
    \vspace{3mm}
    Consider an increase of the federal MW to \$9 in January 2020.
    \begin{itemize}
    	\vspace{1mm}
    	\item Changes income $\{\Delta Y_i\}_{i\in\Z}$ and housing expenditure $\{\Delta H_i\}_{i\in\Z}$

	\frametitle{Pass-through coefficients}

	Define pass-through coefficients as	
	\begin{equation*}
		\rho_i := \frac{\Delta H_i}{\Delta Y_i} =  \frac{h^{\text{Post}}_i R^{\text{Post}}_i - h^{\text{Pre}}_i R^{\text{Pre}}_i}{\Delta Y_i}
	\end{equation*}
	where 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $h$ denotes rented space in $i$ (square feet)
		\item Pre and Post indicate moments before and after the increase
	\end{itemize}

	\pause
	\vspace{3mm}
	Change in rented space are unobserved. We assume $h^{\text{Pre}}_i = h^{\text{Post}}_i = h_i$ so
	\begin{equation*}
		\rho_i = \frac{h^{\text{Post}}_i R^{\text{Post}}_i - h^{\text{Pre}}_i R^{\text{Pre}}_i}{\Delta Y_i} = h_i \frac{\Delta R_i}{\Delta Y_i}
	\end{equation*}
	If $\Delta h_i > 0$ then our estimate of $\rho_i$ is a lower bound.

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Pass-through under the model}

	According to the model,
	$$
	\Delta \ln R_i = \beta \MW_i^{\text{wkr}} + \gamma \MW_i^{\text{res}}
	$$
	We also define
	$$
	\Delta \ln Y_i = \varepsilon \MW_i^{\text{wkr}}
	$$

	Algebra implies
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{split}

				\right] \\

	\end{equation*}
	where
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $\alpha_i = \frac{h_i R_i}{Y_i}$ is the share of $i$'s expenditure in housing

\begin{frame}
	\frametitle{Conclusion}
	
	\begin{itemize}
	    \item When studying effects of place-based policies on the housing market it is crucial
	     to account for the fact that agents live and work in different locations.
		 \vspace{1mm}
	     \item We estimate an elasticity of workplace MW to rents of about $0.065$, and of residence MW of $-0.03$.
		 \vspace{1mm}
	     \item Our estimates imply that landlords pocket between 5 and 15 cents cents on the dollar of the extra 
	     income that MW policies put on the table.
		 \vspace{1mm}
	     \item Landlords in areas right outside of where the MW policies are implemented are those that are set to extract the most rents. 
	     \item Even with a two-parameter model, we are able to describe and predict rich patterns in the rental markets.

	where 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $p_i(\MW_i)$ gives the price of local consumption, increasing in residence MW;

	Let $h_{iz}^*$ and $c_{iz}^*$ denote Marshallian demands, and 
	$\tilde h_{iz}^*$ denote the Hicksian housing demand.

	\vspace{2mm}

	By assumption, the price of the MW will increase prices of non-tradable consumption.
	Thus, consider the effect of an increase in $p_i$ on housing demand.
	The Slutsky equation implies that
	\[
	\frac{\partial h_{iz}^*}{\partial p_i} 
	= \frac{\partial \tilde h_{iz}^*}{\partial p_i} 
	- \frac{\partial h_{iz}^*}{\partial y_{iz}} c_{iz}^*
	\]

	Then, we have that 
	\[
	\frac{\partial h_{iz}^*}{\partial p_i} < 0 \iff 
	\frac{\partial \tilde h_{iz}^*}{\partial p_i} 
	< \frac{\partial h_{iz}^*}{\partial y_{iz}} c_{iz}^*
	\]
