%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In this section we present our main results. Initially, we use the \textit{static} model
to estimate an elasticity of the MW to rents of about 0.026 (s.e. 0.013). We check the
robustness of our results by progressively including plausible controls for the dynamics 
of the local economy, and by including parametric local trends. Our results do not change.

Following the reasoning in \autoref{sec:empirical_strategy}, we then present estimates of 
\textit{dynamic} models. Results show a short-lived dynamic effect, mainly over the two
months following the policy: we estimate the cumulative impact of a 10 percent MW increase 
to be between 0.5 and 0.6 percent over the course of the 5 months after the policy change. 
We find no pre-trends in our estimations, which under the assumption of fixed housing supply 
we interpret as evidence in favor of our identification assumption. We indirectly assess the 
validity of the housing supply assumption by running a placebo regression where we replace 
our main dependent variable with the number of listings \textit{for sale} in Zillow. 
Finally, we estimate panel models that include the lagged dependent variable as control,
which deliver a similar long run effect.

We conduct two exercises to assess to what extent our results estimated in the Zillow sample 
are representative of the underlying average treatment effect across the population of urban
zipcodes. First, we re-estimate our static model via weighted regression, where weights for 
each zipcode are constructed so that our sample matches demographic statistics of the top 100 
CBSA.  As expected, we find that the estimated elasticity increases slightly. Second, we 
re-estimate our static model on a expanded sample that includes the whole set of zipcodes 
available in the Zillow data, no matter the data they ``entered'' the panel. We account for 
changes in zipcode composition by controlling for entry cohort $\times$ time fixed effects. 
Our results show robust to this exercise.

After establishing the robustness of our results, we follow the strategy outlined in 
\autoref{sec:strategy_heterogeneity} to investigate how the incidence of the effect may vary 
across the distribution of zipcode characteristics. First, we use LODES data to proxy for MW 
workers residence and workplace location to show how effects disproportionately affect those 
zipcode that are more likely to have low-wage workers as residents. Secondly, we estimate the 
heterogeneous impact of MW changes across the distribution of several census-based 
demographics. The results indicate that the effects are concentrated in poorer, less-educated, 
and more African-American zipcodes. 

Importantly, all regressions cluster standard errors at the state level so to match the main 
source of variation of MW changes.

\subsection{Baseline Results}\label{sec:baseline_results}

\autoref{tab:static_model} presents results from the static model defined in \autoref{eq:did}. In 
column 1, we show the classical two-way fixed effects model --zipcode and monthly date--, 
estimated in first differences. A potential threat to the identification is the presence of 
unobserved shocks systematically affecting MW and rent changes. In order to account for this 
possibility, in columns 2 to 5 we show results of several models with different sets of controls 
that proxy for shocks to the local economy in columns 2, 3, and 4. As we discussed in the previous 
section, the controls are taken from the QCEW and thus vary either at the county-month or 
county-quarter level. While this prevents us from studying the presence of time-varying 
confounding factors at the zipcode-level, the controls plausibly capture shocks correlated with 
MW changes, which are also decided at higher levels of aggregation than the zipcode --i.e., city, 
county, or state levels. In fact, if there are underlying factors affecting MW changes that also 
affect zipcode-level rents, they would likely arise from this larger geographic units. 

Wages, employment and the number of establishments are also potentially affected by MW changes,
which may result in an invalid regression due to the use of ``bad controls'' 
\parencite{AngristPischke2009}. To avoid this problem we only include controls from industries 
that are unlikely to be affected by MW policies. These are ``Professional and Business Services", 
%% UPDATE SECTORS AFTER REVIEW
``Information", and ``Financial activities". The controls used in the regression are as follows:
column 2 includes average weekly wages at the county-quarter level; column 3 controls for 
employment at the county-month level; column 4 uses the number of establishments in the 
corresponding county and quarter. We include the difference in the log of each variable in our
regressions. Finally, in column 5 we jointly account for all sets of controls. All specifications 
return very similar results. A 10 percent increase in the MW leads to a 0.26 percent increase 
in rents. 

One may still worry that heterogeneous dynamics in local markets at the zipcode level bias our 
results. To account for that, \autoref{tab:did_trend} in the appendix reports estimation 
results of the static model that include zipcode-specific linear and quadratric trends as controls. 
Reassuringly, the coefficient of interest does not change.

	\end{minipage}
\end{table}

A causal interpretation of the estimates from the static model relies on a \textit{strict exogeneity} 
assumption, which states that minimum wage changes are orthogonal to past and future changes in rents.
This assumption may not hold in practice. One way to assess its validity is by a classical 
``pre-trends test''. To conduct that test we estimate a dynamic model with leads and lags of MW 
changes, and evaluate whether coefficients on leads are zero. Under the assumption that the MW does 
not affect the supply of rentals, economic shocks leading to both increases in the MW and rents would 
show up as non-zero pre-trends. A second problem with the strict exogeneity assumption, although a less 
concerning one, is that it presupposes no dynamic effect of MW changes. This restriction is eased by 
the inclusion of lags in the model.

In \autoref{fig:dynamic_models_main}, we plot the estimated coefficients of the \textit{dynamic} model 
(including the full set of economic controls) together with 90\% confidence intervals. In the 
appendix (\autoref{tab:dynamic_lags_leads_main}) we show the full set of coefficients, fit 
statistics, and a p-value of an F-test of the hypothesis that all leads are jointly equal to zero, 
for models with varying sets of controls. The confidence intervals of the pre-trend coefficients in 
\autoref{fig:dynamic_model_coeffs} always include zero. Furthermore, as shown in the appendix we 
always fail to reject the hypothesis of no pre-trends. Consistent with a causal interpretation of 
our results, future MW changes do not have an effect on current rental prices. 

We stress that this interpretation relies on the assumption that the supply of rental units is 
not affected by MW changes. Given the high-frequency of our data, we believe this assumption is 
likely to hold. We provide indirect evidence of this assumption in the appendix  
(\autoref{fig:placebo_nlist}), where we estimate our main dynamic model on the number of listings 
\textit{for sale} in Zillow. The results, although somewhat noisy, suggest that MW changes not 
affect the number of listings for sale in Zillow. Because this variable is likely to be correlated 
with the number of rentals, we see this result as evidence in favor of the assumption of fixed supply. 
The supply of rentals, however, may also be affected by the MW in terms of its quality. For instance, 
it is possible that the quality of houses in Zillow increases after a MW increase, leading to a 
spurious rise in their price.  Unfortunately, due to data limitations we are not able to study this 
possibility. Our results then hinge on the assumption that quality of rental units is not affected 
by the MW.

The strict exogeneity assumption seems to be failing with respect to the lags. Our dynamic model 
captures a short-lived persistence of the effect of MW changes on rents. Following a 10 percent 
change in the MW, we estimate that rents increase by 0.26 in the same month and 0.15 percent in the 
month \textit{after} the change, while the impact appears to vanish after the first two periods. 
\autoref{fig:dynamic_model_cumsum} shows the cumulative sum of the coefficients in the dynamic model,
together with 90\% confidence bands. The cumulative effects seems to stabilize after a significant 
increase in the period of the MW increase and the following one. \autoref{tab:dynamic_lags_leads_main}
reports a cumulative sum of coefficients for our preferred model with the full set of controls 
of 0.058 (s.e. 0.034), meaning that a 10 percent rise in the MW leads to a 0.58 percent increase 
in rents after 5 months.
%%% REVIEW EXACT NUMBERS AFTER CHANGING CONTROLS

Given that our models are not designed to estimate the long-run effect of the policy, we see the
standard errors on the cumulative effect as excessively large. The first attempt to obtain a more
precise estimate of this quantity is to estimate a dynamic model including distributed lags only. 
\autoref{fig:dynamic_models_main} shows such a model alongside the fully dynamic one. The top panel 
shows that the coefficients on lags are almost identical in this model, whereas the bottom panel 
suggests the cumulative effect follows a similar pattern, but in this case with slightly tighter 
confidence bands. A second way to obtain a more precise estimate of the long-run effect is by the 
panel specification in \autoref{eq:ab_panel}. In such a model, the long-run effect can be estimated 
as a non-linear transformation of three coefficients. \autoref{fig:dynamic_model_cumsum} shows such 
an estimate, which has a nearly identical magnitude but a considerably smaller confidence interval.
We report exact values for this estimate in \autoref{tab:horse_race_ab} in the appendix.

As we discussed before, the advantages of panel specifications go beyond computing a long-run effect.
This model accounts for the possibility that auto-correlation in the dependent variable bias our 
estimates. Furthermore, the identification in the panel model is valid under a weaker assumption on 
the relation between MW and rents changes: sequential exogeneity. \autoref{tab:horse_race_ab} in the 
appendix shows complete results for panel specifications alongside our main dynamic models. Columns 1, 
2, and 3 show coefficients from equations the static, dynamic, and lags only model respectively. Columns 
4 and 5 show results of panel specifications with and without leads. We recover the coefficients via 
instrumental variables following the well-known \textcite{ArellanoBond1991} approach, i.e., by using 
deeper lags of the dependent variable to instrument for the lagged dependent variable. Reassuringly, 
the estimated coefficients on leads and lags of our MW variable are very similar between the dynamic
and panel models. We interpret this result as rendering supporting our main identification assumptions
in the dynamic model. Focusing on the lags only model, we estimate a highly significant auto-correlation 
coefficient in the rents variable of 0.43. The implied long-run effect is 0.06 (s.e. 0.024).

\subsection{Sample Selection Concerns and External Validity}\label{sec:sample_rest}

Our results suggest a noticeable impact of MW policies on the rental housing market. However, as 
explained in \autoref{sec:data}, the set of zipcodes for estimation constitutes a sample of, on 
average, more urban and richer zipcodes. This, in turn, may imply that our estimated effect has 
limited validity in other places. Additionally, the zipcodes included in the final sample are the 
ones appearing earlier in the Zillow data (i.e. zipcodes whose rent data are available since July 
2015). The zipcodes selected into the sample by this rule may differ from the average zipcode 
in unobservable dimensions that affect our results. In this section we conduct two exercises to 
test the sensitivity of our results to our sample.

First of all, we estimate our model on an \textit{unbalanced} panel of zipcodes, constructed by 
extending our panel to include the full set of zipcodes for which there is available rent data in 
Zillow. This, on one hand, doubles the sample size and increases significantly the number of MW 
events. %% SH: By how much? Make some numbers
On the other hand, as we now include zipcodes whose entry date to the panel is any month between
2010 and 2019, this procedure makes the composition of our sample vary strongly over time by. To 
account for the fact that zipcodes entering the panel in different dates may experience different 
dynamics, we estimate our models with controls for ``cohort'' $\times$ monthly date fixed effects. 
As a result, our regressions compare treated and untreated zipcodes conditional on length of their 
data.

Secondly, we assess the representativeness of our estimates by re-weighting zipcodes so as to match 
socio-demographic characteristics of the zipcodes in the top-100 CBSA. We do this by applying the 
entropy balancing procedure developed by \cite{hainmueller2012entropy} on the following zipcode 
level demographics: share of rental houses, share of African-American residents, share of college 
graduates, and median income. We target averages from \autoref{tab:desc_stats}, column 
2.\footnote{The entropy balancing procedure consists of a re-weighting scheme that assigns a scalar 
	weight to every unit such that the re-weighted sample matches moments of a target population. 
	Our implementation uses the \texttt{STATA} package \texttt{ebalance}, described in 
	\textcite{hainmueller2013ebalance}.} 
Armed with the set of weights, we re-estimate our models via weighted regression.

In \autoref{tab:wgt_unbal_comparison} we compare baseline results with those obtained from the 
two exercises. For each specification, we show the estimated impact from the static model, the 
cumulative effect obtained from the distributed lags model, and the long-run effect computed after
IV estimation of a distributed lags panel model. Column 3 shows the results obtained from 
estimating weighted models. The point estimate is now over 50\% higher, although the confidence 
interval includes the point estimate of the baseline model. The reweighted model suggests that the 
average effect of a 10 percent increase in MW is a 0.39 percent increase in same-month rents, 0.73 
percent after 5 months according to the dynamic model, and 0.69 in the long-run according to our 
panel specification. We interpret this as suggestive evidence that, in our selected sample of 
richer than average zipcodes, the effect of MW increases tends to be smaller. Column 2 shows that 
using the unbalanced panel results in slightly lower estimates. In particular, the panel 
specification is not estimated very precisely, resulting in a statistically non-significant 
long-run effect. This can be in part explained by the fact that these models include many more 
fixed effects, although it also suggests that zipcodes that entered earlier to our data experience 
somewhat larger impacts of MW changes.

In addition, \autoref{fig:dynamic_wgt_unabl_comp} in the Appendix shows the coefficients and 
cumulative sum from our dynamic models. Both panels show a remarkably similar pattern when compared 
to \autoref{fig:dynamic_models_main}. The reweighted and unbalanced model both show an absence of 
pre-trends, as well as a two-months dynamic effect following a MW increase.

\subsection{The Heterogeneous Impact of MW Changes on Rents}\label{sec:heter}

Our baseline results in this section documented a significant effect of changes in the MW
on changes in rents per square foot. We argued that, given some reasonable assumptions on the 
behavior of unobservables, this effect can be interpreted casually. Furthermore, we provided
suggestive evidence in favor of those assumptions and discussed alternative assumptions 
that yield similar results (the panel specification). We showed in robustness exercises that 
our results persist under different samples, and that the average treatment effect for the 
universe of urban zipcodes in the U.S. is likely larger than the one in our selected sample. 


In this subsection we explore how the effect varies across the distribution of observable 
characteristics of zipcodes. The goal of this exercise is to understand who are the ``winners" 
and ``losers" when rents increase due to new MW provisions. As explained in 
\autoref{sec:strategy_heterogeneity}, we use our static model for this analysis. In particular, 
we assign zipcodes to state-specific quartile groups of the distribution of some characteristic, 
and interact our MW variable with indicators for those groups. 

\autoref{tab:fd_model_het} shows the main results, where we report heterogeneity for 5 
characteristics. Columns 1 to 3 study heterogeneity based on zipcode demographics from the 
Census and the ACS. Column 1 starts with median household income. While the effect appears to 
be larger for zipcodes with lower income, none of the interaction coefficients is statistically 
significant. A possible explanation is that zipcode median income might still be associated 
with substantial variation in the relative share of MW residents directly affected by the income 
shock. In other words, unlike previous research \parencite[e.g.][]{AutorEtAl2016}, the relevant 
``bite'' of the MW is probably not well captured by the distribution of income in the geographical
unit of analysis. Column 2 focuses on the share of college graduates. The estimates suggest that 
lower-educated neighborhoods experience a larger rent increase. In fact, there is a clear divide 
between above median zipcodes, which show non-significant effects, and below median ones, with 
significant effects of 0.35 and a 0.45, larger in magnitude to our baseline estimate of 0.026 for 
the static effect. In column 4 we show the impact across the distribution over share of 
African-American residents. The effect of MW changes on rents is not significant in any of the 
first three quarters. The fourth quarter, however, shows a relatively high point estimate of 
0.04 (s.e. 0.016). The negative effects of increasing rents appear to fall disproportionately 
on zipcodes with more African-American residents.

% SH: I dropped the unemployment rate and teen share from the table, thus I commented out the below

%In column 2 we focus on the zipcode-level unemployment rate. Not surprisingly, we find that the 
%strongest effect is localized in the $4^{th}$ quartile of the distribution, 0.043 (s.e. 0.017). 
%Estimates lose significance in the remaining part of the distribution: similarly to column 1, we 
%find not-significant not-monotone estimates in the middle quartiles, while the effect is a clear 
%zero in the bottom quarter. Perhaps not surprisingly, classifying zipcodes according to a 
%demographic characteristic more closely associated with the status of MW earner indeed suggest 
%how the bulk of the impact is concentrated in areas where is more likely to have MW residents.

% Lastly, in column (5) we reports the estimated interaction coefficients obtained with quartiles 
% based on the share of residents between 15 and 24 years old, a strong predictor of MW worker status 
% (ADD REFERENCE).

Columns 4 and 5 present results for the heterogeneous impact of MW increases based on share of 
young low-income workers who work and reside in the zipcode, which proxies for the share of MW 
workers workplace and residence. More precisely, and as explained in \autoref{sec:data/other_data} 
we use the LODES data to identify, for each zipcode in our sample, the number of workers and 
residents younger than 29 years old earning less than \$1,251 per month. 
%% DATA SECTION SAYS 30 years old. WHICH IS RIGHT?
We then compute the zipcode-level share of MW workers and residents, out of state totals. As a 
result, we identify those zipcodes that constitutes either the workplace or the residence for a 
higher share of MW earners. Column 4 shows the effect for the share of MW jobs out of state totals. 
Note how the effect appears not to vary widely across the distribution, suggesting that the effect 
is orthogonal to this characteristic. However, the precision of such estimates decreases as we go 
from the first to the fourth quartile, as documented by growing confidence intervals. Column 3, on 
the other hand, shows a positive relationship between the share of MW residents and the intensity 
of the impact of MW on rents. The effect for zipcodes with the lowest share of MW residents is a 
precisely estimated zero effect, while the elasticity for the third quartile leads is 0.5 (s.e. 
0.02), strongly significant and larger in magnitude than our baseline result from the static model. 
The estimated effect in the upper quartile diminishes to 0.26 and it is not statistically 
significant.\footnote{\label{ft:long_tail}  %%% IMPROVE THIS FOOTNOTE
	This is probably related to the long right tail in the underlying distribution of the shares, 
	which introduces a great deal of heterogeneity in the last quartile (see 
	\autoref{fig:lodes_share_dist} in the appendix). [IS THIS SO? CHECK]}

The use of zipcode-level state shares helps in identifying the geographical spread of MW 
workers/residents within a state. This approach has the shortcoming of not accounting for 
population size of the zipcode. For example, richer and highly populated zipcodes may host a large 
fraction of the state population of MW workers, but these may still account for a small proportion 
of the zipcode population and thus have small bearing on the housing market. To better identify 
neighborhoods with a higher relative concentration of MW workers/residents, we re-estimate the 
heterogeneous impact of MW on rents by using zipcode-level shares instead. We display these results 
in the appendix, \autoref{fig:static_qtl_lodes}, together with the estimates using state-specific 
shares for comparison. Although somewhat more noisy, results are similar in the sense that top 
quartiles of the residence distribution show larger effects, whereas this distinction is not 
present over the workplace distribution.
