In this section we present our main results.
First, we show our baseline estimates and conduct several robustness checks to 
explore the strength of our results.
Second, we present results of models that use alternative empirical strategies.
Third, we show heterogeneity analysis based on the residence location of MW 
workers and discuss other concerns that arise from the selectivity of our 
sample of ZIP codes.
Finally, we summarize our results and compare them with existing literature.

\subsection{Main Results}
\label{sec:results_main}

Table \ref{tab:static} displays our estimates using the baseline sample 
described in Section \ref{sec:data_final_panel}.
Column (1) shows the results of a first-differenced regression of the workplace
MW measure on the residence MW measure, economic controls and monthly date fixed
effects.
We observe that a 10 percent increase in the residence MW induces an 
8.6 percent increase in the workplace MW.
While the measures are strongly correlated, this model shows that this 
correlation is far from exact, suggesting that there is independent variation
to estimate the effect of both measures on rents.

Columns (2) through (4) of Table \ref{tab:static} show estimates of equation 
\eqref{eq:fd}, varying the set of included MW measures.
Column (2) shows the results of estimating a model that does not include the 
workplace MW.
In this model, only locations with a statutory MW change are assumed to 
experience effects, similar to much of the MW literature 
\parencite[e.g.,][]{DubeEtAl2010, MeerWest2016, Yamagishi2021}.
In this case, we estimate that a $10$ percent increase in the MW is associated 
with a statistically significant $0.27$ percent increase in median rents.
Column (3) shows the results of a model that does not include the residence MW.
The coefficient on the MW variable seems to increase slightly, consistent with 
the view that changes in the workplace MW are a better proxy of the changes in 
disposable income generated by MW increases.
Column (4) estimates the model using both MW measures.
Consistent with the theoretical model in Section \ref{sec:model}, the 
coefficient on the residence MW ($\gamma$) now turns negative and equals 
$-0.0204$, although it is not statistically significant ($t=-1.21$).
The coefficient on the workplace MW ($\beta$) increases to $0.0545$ and is 
statistically significant ($t=1.93$).
We reject the hypothesis that $\gamma=\beta$ at the 10\% significance level 
($p = 0.096$).
Finally, $\gamma+\beta$ is estimated to be $0.0342$ ($t=2.21$), very similar in
magnitude of coefficients on MW variables in columns (2) and (3).
Thus, our results imply that a 10 percent increase in both MW measures will 
increase rents by $0.34$ percent.
However, if only the residence MW increases then rents are expected to decline,
and if only the workplace MW goes up then the rents increase will be larger.
%% SH: Tried to shorten this paragraph a bit.
%%     We can proved more discussion in the last subsection of this tex file

A central concern with these results is whether our identifying assumptions is 
likely to hold.
Figure \ref{fig:dynamic_baseline} shows estimates of equation 
\eqref{eq:fd_leads_lags} under the baseline sample.
Panel (a) adds leads and lags of the workplace MW measure only, so that
our set of coefficients is now 
$\{\{\beta_s\}_{s=-6}^{-1},\beta,\{\beta_s\}_{s=1}^6,\gamma\}$.
We cannot reject the hypothesis that $\beta_{-6}=...=\beta_{-1}=0$ 
($p = 0.856$).
Estimates of post-event coefficients $\{\beta_s\}_{s=1}^6$ are also estimated to 
be zero.
The only significant estimates are those of $\beta$ and $\gamma$, and they 
imply larger and more significant effects of both the residence and workplace MW
measures.
Our estimate of $\gamma$ is now $-0.0306$, and is statistically significant 
at the 10\% level ($t=-1.82$).
Our estimate of $\beta_0$ equals $0.0683$ and is statistically 
significant at the 1\% level ($t=2.52$).
Furthermore, in this case we can reject the hypothesis of equality of 
coefficients more precisely ($p = 0.025$).
Our estimate of $\gamma+\beta$ is now $0.0377$ and is highly significant 
($t=2.45$), impying that a 10 percent increase in both measures would increase
rents by $0.38$ percent.

Panel (b) of Figure \ref{fig:dynamic_baseline} shows that a similar story 
obtains when we add leads and lags of the residence MW only.
Panel (c) of Figure \ref{fig:dynamic_baseline} adds leads and lags of both MW 
measures.
In this case, the width of confidence intervals for pre- and post-event 
coefficients increases between 2 to 4 times.
We attribute this fact to the strong correlation of the MW measures in our
panel, which implies that these coefficients are weakly identified.
However, the event-period coefficients are similar to those of 
panels (a) and (b).

Appendix Figure \ref{fig:map_residuals_chicago_jul2019} illustrates the 
identifying variation that we use by mapping the residualized workplace MW and 
residualized log rents.%
\footnote{To maximize the number of ZIP codes with valid data on this map we
use the results of the unbalanced panel discussed in Section 
\ref{sec:results_heterogeneity}.}
Panel (a) of Appendix Figure \ref{fig:map_residuals_chicago_jul2019}, to be 
contrasted with Panel (a) of Figure \ref{fig:map_mw_chicago_jul2019}, 
shows that residualized workplace MW is high outside of Cook County, the 
jurisdiction that increased the MW.
Panel (b) of Appendix Figure \ref{fig:map_residuals_chicago_jul2019} shows 
that residualized rents are very noisy.
The correlation of these residualized variables across our sample identifies
the effect of the workplace MW.

\subsubsection*{Robustness Checks}

Table \ref{tab:robustness} shows how our results change when we vary the
specification of the regression model and the commuting shares used 
to construct the workplace MW measure.
Each row of the table shows estimates analogous to those of columns (1) and (4)
of Table \ref{tab:static}.

Panel A of Table \ref{tab:robustness} groups the results when varying the 
regression model.
Row (b) shows that our results are very similar when we we exclude the 
economic controls from the QCEW.
Rows (c) and (d) show that interacting our time fixed effects with indicators 
for county or CBSA yields similar results.
In all these cases our baseline estimates are contained in relevant 
confidence intervals and, in the case of CBSA $\times$ monthly date fixed 
effects, the results seem even larger.
This supports the view that our results are not caused by regional trends 
in housing markets correlated with our MW variables.
Row (e) shows that the results are different when using state $\times$ 
monthly date fixed effects.
While our baseline estimates are within relevant confidence intervals, the 
signs of the point estimates are flipped.
We think that within-state comparisons are not appropriate because they fully 
identify coefficients from local MW changes which, in turn, are more likely to 
be passed by cities or counties that have more dynamic rental markets.
On the other hand, within-CBSA and within-county comparisons use ZIP codes that
are likely to experience similar trends in rental markets.
Row (f) includes ZIP code fixed effects in the first-differenced model, which
is equivalent to allowing for a linear trend in the model in levels.
The fact that our results are very similar implies that potential ZIP code 
level linear trends correlated with MW changes are unlikely to be the cause
of our results.

Panel B of Table \ref{tab:robustness} estimates the baseline model but 
computing the workplace MW using alternative commuting structures.
Rows (g) and (h) uses commuting shares from 2014 or 2018 instead of 2017 as 
the baseline estimates.
Row (i) allows the commuting shares to vary by year, introducing additional
cross-year variation in the workplace MW measure that does not arise from 
changes in the statutory MW.
The fact that these specifications yield very similar results suggests that 
changes in commuting correlated to MW changes are unlikely to be the driver
of the results.
Rows (j) and (l) use 2017 commuting shares for workers that earn less than 
\$1,251 per month and workers that are less than 29, respectively.
If anything, the results seem to be stronger in this case, consistent
with the idea that these workers are more likely to earn close to the 
minimum wage.

\subsubsection*{Alternative Rental Categories}

Appendix Table \ref{tab:zillow_categories} shows how our results change when we 
use other rental categories available in the Zillow data.
%% SH: Before we had ' and less common rental categories'
%%     Dropped the 'less common' part because it's meaning is ambiguous. Better
%%     to say that the categories have fewer observations, as we do below
The sample in each row is constructed starting from the baseline sample used in 
Table \ref{tab:static} and keeping only ZIP codes that have valid data in the 
given rental category.
We note that the number of observations varies widely and is always much lower
than in our baseline.

Given the reduced precision of these estimates is hard to obtain strong 
conclusions on what type of housing is reacting more strongly to MW changes.
Results in the categories ``Condominium and Cooperative Houses'' and 
``3 bedroom'' resemble our baseline estimates the most.
We observe inconsistent results for the category ``1 bedroom'' where the sign 
of the coefficients is flipped relative to baseline.
However, these are not statistically significant.

\subsubsection*{Other geographies and time frames}

In this subsection, we compare our results with estimates obtained from 
alternative panels where the unit of observation is the county by month, 
ZIP code by year, and county by year.
The reason to show these results is twofold.
First, it allows us to emphasize how important is the ZIP code and monthly 
resolution of our data for the plausibility of our identification assumption.
Namely, that the no pre-trends assumption at the ZIP code level is more 
plausible than at the county level.
Second, it allows us to compare our results with the previous literature 
estimating the effects of MW on housing rents.
Because none of the previous papers distinguish between workplace and residence
MW measures, we compare them to our short model that regresses log rents on
the workplace MW only.
The results for each dataset are summarized in Appendix Table 
\ref{tab:static_geos_times}, where each panel has a structure analogous
to Table \ref{tab:static}.

Panel B shows our results based on a county by month panel.
Overall, the results in are similar in magnitude to our baseline results 
but are not statistically significant.
In Appendix Figure \ref{fig:dynamic_county_month} we extend the model
that includes both MW measures adding leads and lags, as in panel (a) of Figure 
\ref{fig:dynamic_baseline}.
We observe considerable pre-trends in the rental prices that are cannot be 
controlled for by this model, illustrating the using data at a high 
geographical resolution.

Panels C and D show results estimated using ZIP code by year and county by
year panels, respectively.
Because these models are simply an yearly average of the models at a 
monthly frequency, they should be valid.
However, in practice we find that estimates are very imprecise, with standard
errors 3 to 5 times larger.
Our rental changes occur right at the month of the MW change, thus using 
yearly variation lacks the power to detect them.

Using Fair Market Rents data at the county by year level, 
\textcite[][, Tables 1 and 2]{Yamagishi2019} use a long-differences 
specification and obtains null results using all counties and statistically 
significant results using densely populated counties.
In the latter case, he reports that a 10 percent increase in the MW increases
rents by $0.0365$ percent in the first year, and $0.1059$ percent four years 
later.
Our ZIP code-level estimates using only the workplace MW imply a one-time 
increase in rents of a similar magnitude as \citeauthor{Yamagishi2019}'s 
\textcite[][Table 2, Column 1]{Yamagishi2019} one-year estimates.
While our results are consistent in this sense, 
\parencite[][table 3]{Yamagishi2019} detects significant pre-trends,
questioning the validity of the longer-run results.%
\footnote{\textcite{Tidemann2018} uses the same data at the state level and 
reports the paradoxical result that MW hikes decrease monthly rents.
\textcite[][, Appendix C.1.3.]{Yamagishi2019} compares his results with 
\textcite{Tidemann2018} and concludes that for densely populated areas 
Tidemann's result turns positive and that clustering the standard errors at the
state level renders his results insignificant.}

\subsection{Alternative Strategies}
\label{sec:results_alternative_strategies}

Appendix Table \ref{tab:stacked_w6} estimates our main models using a 
``stacked'' sample, as discussed in Section \ref{sec:alt_emp_strategies}.
Our sample contains 618 ``events,'' that is, CBSA-month pairs that had some 
strict subset of ZIP codes increasing the residence MW.
These estimates interact the year-month fixed effects with event-id indicators, 
and thus compare ZIP codes within the same CBSA.
This is in line with recent difference-in-differences literature that 
focuses on carefully selecting the comparison groups 
\parencite{CallawayEtAl2021, deChaisemartinEtAl2022, RothEtAl2022}.
Relative to Table \ref{tab:static} this model has less observations and includes 
many more fixed effects.
Nevertheless, we find very similar albeit less precise results.
We reject the hypothesis of equality of the residence and workplace MW at the
10\% significance level.
In this case, a 10 percent increase in both MW measures is estimated to 
increase rents by $0.375$ percent, in line with the results of the previous 
subsection.

Appendix Table \ref{tab:static_ab} shows estimates of a model that includes
the lagged difference in log rents as a covariate.
This specification relaxes the strict exogeneity assumption and allows for 
feedback effects of rent increases on the minimum wage variables.
To avoid the endogeneity problem of including this covariate the models are 
estimated using an IV strategy where we instrument the first lag of the change 
in rents with the second lag of this variable 
\parencite{ArellanoBond1991,ArellanoHonore2001}.
This estimation strategy also yields very similar but less precise results
when compared to our baeline in the previous subsection.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Heterogeneity and Representativeness of the Results}
\label{sec:results_heterogeneity}

Table \ref{tab:static_sample} explores the senstivity of our estimates to 
the sample of ZIP codes used in estimation.
Columns (1), (3), and (5) use our baseline sample of ZIP codes, 
a fully-balanced sample dropping all data prior to July 2015, and
an unbalanced sample of ZIP codes where we control for year-of-entry by
year-month fixed effects.
While the coefficient on the residence MW is very stable across specifications,
the one on the workplace MW seems to increase slightly when using the fully-balanced
sample, and to decrease slightly under the unbalanced sample.
Our baseline sample achieves more precision at the cost of allowing the 
composition of ZIP codes to change before 2015.
We also worry that our ZIP codes might be a selected sample in ways that affect
our estimated effects.
In columns (2), (4), and (6) we estimate the same models but reweighting 
observations to match relevant characteristics of the sample of urban 
ZIP codes.%
\footnote{In particular, samples are reweighted to match the share of renter
households, the estimated share of MW residents, the share of workers aged
less then 29, and the share of workers in the ``Accomodation and Food Services''
industry.}
The re-weighting seems not to affect the estimated coefficients.

\subsection{Summary and Discussion}
\label{sec:results_discussion}

Faced with an increase of the statutory MW at some jurisdiction, our results
indicate that its sptail effect across rental markets will be determined by 
its incidence on each of the MW measures.
