In this section we present our main results.
First, we show our baseline estimates and we discuss how our results change
when using alternative specifications.
Second, we conduct several robustness checks to explore the strength of 
our results.
Third, we show heterogeneity analysis based on the residence location of MW 
workers.
Finally, we summarize our results and compare them with existing literature.

\subsection{Main Results}
\label{sec:results_main}

Table \ref{tab:static} shows our estimates using the baseline sample 
described in \ref{sec:data_final_panel}.
Column (1) shows the results of a first-differenced regression of the workplace
MW measure on the residence MW measure, economic controls and year-month fixed
effects.
We observe that a 10 percent increase in the residence MW induces an 
8.6 percent increase in the workplace MW.
While the measures are strongly correlated, this model shows that this 
correlation is far from exact, suggesting that there is independent variation
to estimate the effect of both measures on rents.

Columns (2) through (4) of Table \ref{tab:static} show estimates of equation 
\eqref{eq:fd}, varying the set of included MW measures.
Column (2) shows the results of estimating a model that does not include the 
workplace MW.
In this model, only locations with a statutory MW change are assumed to 
experience effects, similar to much of the MW literature 
\parencite[e.g.,][]{DubeEtAl2010, MeerWest2016, Yamagishi2021}.
In this case, we estimate that a $10$ percent increase in the MW is associated 
with a statistically significant $0.27$ percent increase in median rents.
Column (3) shows the results of a model that does not include the residence MW.
The coefficient on the MW variable seems to increase slightly, consistent with 
the view that changes in the workplace MW are a better proxy of the changes in 
disposable income generated by MW increases.
Column (4) estimates the model using both MW measures.
Consistent with the theoretical model in Section \ref{sec:model}, the 
coefficient on the residence MW ($\gamma$) now turns negative and equals 
$-0.0204$, although it is not statistically significant ($t=-1.21$).
The coefficient on the workplace MW ($\beta$) increases to $0.0545$ and is 
statistically significant ($t=1.93$).
We reject the hypothesis that $\gamma=\beta$ at the 10\% significance level 
($p = 0.096$).
Finally, $\gamma+\beta$ has a magnitude of $0.0342$, very similar to the one 
in column (3), and is highly significant ($t=2.21$).
Thus, our results imply that a 10 percent increase in both MW measures will 
increase rents by $0.34$ percent.
However, if only the residence MW increases then rents are expected to decline,
and if only the workplace MW goes up then the rents increase will be larger.

A main concern with these results is whether our identifying assumptions is 
likely to hold.
Figure \ref{fig:dynamic_baseline} shows estimates of equation 
\eqref{eq:fd_leads_lags} under the baseline sample.
Panel (a) adds leads and lags of the workplace MW measure only, so that
our set of coefficients is now 
$\{\{\beta\}_{s=-6}^{-1},\beta,\{\beta\}_{s=1}^6,\gamma\}$.
We cannot reject the hypothesis that $\beta_{-6}=...=\beta_{-1}=0$ 
($p = 0.856$).
Estimates of post-event coefficients $\{\beta\}_{s=1}^6$ are also estimated to 
be zero.
The only significant estimates are those of $\beta$ and $\gamma$, and they 
imply larger and more significant effects of both residence and workplace MW.
Our estimate of $\gamma$ is now $-0.0306$, and is statistically significant 
at the 10\% level ($t=-1.82$).
Our estimate of $\beta_0$ equals $0.0683$ and is statistically 
significant at the 1\% level ($t=2.52$).
Furthermore, in this case we can reject the hypothesis of equality of coefficients more
precisely ($p = 0.025$).
Our estimate of $\gamma+\beta$ is now $0.0377$ and is highly significant 
($t=2.45$), impying that a 10 percent increase in both measures would increase
rents by $0.38$ percent.

Panel (b) of Figure \ref{fig:dynamic_baseline} shows that a similar story 
obtains when we add leads and lags of the residence MW only.
Panel (c) of Figure \ref{fig:dynamic_baseline} adds leads and lags of both MW 
measures.
In this case, the width of confidence intervals for pre- and post-event 
coefficients increases between 2 to 4 times.
We attribute this fact to the strong correlation of the MW measures in our
panel, which implies that these coefficients are weakly identified.
However, the period-0 coefficients are similar to those of panels (a) and (b).

Appendix Figure \ref{fig:map_residuals_chicago_jul2019} illustrate the 
identifying variation that we use by mapping the residualized workplace MW and 
residualized log rents.%
\footnote{To maximize the number of ZIP codes with valid data on this map we
use the results of the unbalanced panel discussed in Section 
\ref{sec:heterogeneity_results}.}
Panel (a) of Appendix Figure \ref{fig:map_residuals_chicago_jul2019}, to be 
contrasted with Panel (a) of Figure \ref{fig:map_mw_chicago_jul2019}, 
shows that residualized workplace MW is high outside of Cook County, the 
jurisdiction that increased the MW.
Panel (b) of Appendix Figure \ref{fig:map_residuals_chicago_jul2019} shows 
that residualized rents are very noisy.
The correlation of these residualized variables across our sample identifies
the effect of the workplace MW.

\subsubsection*{Robustness Checks}

Table \ref{tab:robustness} shows how our results change when we vary the
specification of the regression model (Panel A) and the commuting shares used 
to construct the workplace MW measure (Panel B).
Each row of the table shows estimates analogous to those of columns (1) and (4)
of Table \ref{tab:static}.

Panel A row (b) of Table \ref{tab:robustness} shows that our results are very similar 
when we we exclude the economic controls from the QCEW. 
The first fact confirms that our economic controls are not driving the results.
Panel A rows (c) to (e) show that including County $\times$ year-month, 
CBSA $\times$ year-month, and Place $\times$ year-month fixed effects
the effects are similar and our baseline estimates are within the confidence 
intervals. This supports the view that our results are not caused by regional 
trends in housing markets correlated with our MW variables.
Panel A row (f) includes ZIP code fixed effects in the first-differenced model,
thus allowing for a ZIP code specific linear trend results are similar. This 
accounts for potential ZIP code level heterogeneity that could be biasing our results.

\subsubsection*{Alternative Rental Categories}

Appendix Table \ref{tab:zillow_categories} shows how our results change when we 
use alternative rental categories in Zillow.
%% SH: Before we had ' and less common rental categories'
%%     Dropped the 'less common' pary because it's meaning is ambiguous. Better
%%     say that the categories have fewer observations, as we do below
The sample in each row is constructed starting from the baseline sample used in 
Table \ref{tab:static} and keeping only ZIP codes that have valid data in the 
given rental category.
We note that the number of observations varies widely and is always much lower
that in our baseline.

Given the reduced precision of these estimates is hard to obtain strong 
conclusions of what type of housing is reacting more strongly.
Results in the categories ``Condominium and Cooperative Houses'' and ``3 bedroom''
resemble the baseline estimates the most.
We observe inconsistent results for ``Studios,'' where the sign of the 
coefficients is flipped relative to baseline.
However, these are not statistically significant.

\subsubsection*{Other geographies and time frames} \label{sec:oth_geo_time}

In this subsection, we compare our results with estimates on alternative panels
that use County-month, ZIP code-year, and Count-year variation. The reason to show 
these results is twofold. First, it allows us to emphasize how important 
is the ZIP code and monthly resolution of our data for the plausibility of our 
identification assumption. Namely, that pretrends ahead of a MW change is much 
less likely at the ZIP code level than at the county level. Second, it allows us 
to benchmark our results with the previous literature estimating the effects of 
MW on housing rents. \textcite{Yamagishi2019} and \textcite{Tidemann2018} use 
county-year variation, and we discuss that why identification is likely to fail.

Appendix Table \ref{tab:cty_vs_zip_mth_vs_yr } Panel B shows our results based on a County 
month panel in which we assigned MW measures by considering as statutory MW the maximum MW within
the County and where we used Zillow data readily available at the County-month. The results in 
row (iii) are similar in magnitude to our baseline results but they are not significant and 
much less precisely estimated. In Appendix Figure \ref{fig:dynamic_county_month}, we display 
for the county-month the analogous to Figure \ref{fig:dynamic_baseline} panel (a), to show that 
at the county month there are considerable pretrends in the rental prices. This illustrates 
the importance of having data with high frequency and high geographic resolution. 

Appendix Table \ref{tab:cty_vs_zip_mth_vs_yr } Panels C and D, show results estimated
using a panel at the ZIP code-year and County-year respectively. In both cases, estimates
are very imprecise and the magnitude of the coefficients is far from the baseline results. 
We interpret this facts as evidence that using yearly variation of the rental prices is not 
well suited for estimating the effects of the MW changes. On the one hand, using yearly variation, 
identification assumptions required to interpret the results as causal are much less likely 
to hold because unobservable determinants of MW changes over time are more likely to be 
related with the yearly rental dynamics. Nevertheless, the exact month when MW changes 
happen is heavily influenced by different legislative calendars of the state and local 
representatives, and therefore observing rents to increase when MW increases is much 
more likely to be causal when using small geographic units and controlling for local 
state of the economy factors. On the other hand, without data around the exact timing of the 
MW changes pretrends test are less informative.

Using Fair Market Rents data at the County-year level, \textcite{Yamagishi2019} employs a 
specification close to the one shown in Appendix Table \ref{tab:cty_vs_zip_mth_vs_yr } 
panel (D) and row (i) and finds that the elasticity of housing rents to residence MW changes 
is of $0.0150$, although his results are not significant. He reports that this elasticity is 
significant at the 10\% level and of about $0.0365$ when focusing in densely populated areas.
\textcite{Tidemann2018} uses the same data and a level model to reports the paradoxical 
result that MW hikes decrease monthly rents in statistically significant way. \textcite{Yamagishi2019} 
Appendix C.1.3. compares his results with \textcite{Tidemann2018} and concludes that for densely 
populated areas Tidemann's result turns positive and that clustering the standard errors at the
state level renders his results insignificant.

\subsection{Alternative Strategies}
\label{sec:results_alternative_strategies}

Appendix Table \ref{tab:stacked_w6} estimates our main models using a 
``stacked'' sample, as discussed in Section \ref{sec:alt_emp_strategies}.
Our sample contains 618 ``events,'' that is, CBSA-month pairs that had some 
strict subset of ZIP codes increasing the residence MW.
These estimates interact the year-month fixed effects with event-id indicators, 
and thus compare ZIP codes within the same CBSA.
This is in line with recent difference-in-differences literature that 
focuses on carefully selecting the comparison groups 
\parencite{CallawayEtAl2021, deChaisemartinEtAl2022, RothEtAl2022}.
Relative to Table \ref{tab:static} this model has less observations and includes 
many more fixed effects.
Nevertheless, we find very similar albeit less precise results.
We reject the hypothesis of equality of the residence and workplace MW at the
10\% significance level.
In this case, a 10 percent increase in both MW measures is estimated to 
increase rents by $0.375$ percent, in line with the results of the previous 
subsection.

Appendix Table \ref{tab:static_ab} shows estimates of a model that includes
the lagged difference in log rents as a covariate.
This specification relaxes the strict exogeneity assumption and allows for 
feedback effects of rent increases on the minimum wage variables.
To avoid the endogeneity problem of including this covariate the models are 
estimated using an IV strategy where we instrument the first lag of the change 
in rents with the second lag of this variable 
\parencite{ArellanoBond1991,ArellanoHonore2001}.
This estimation strategy also yields very similar but less precise results
when compared to our baeline in the previous subsection.

\subsection{Heterogeneity and Representativeness of the Results}
\label{sec:results_heterogeneity}

Table \ref{tab:static_sample} explores the senstivity of our estimates to 
the sample of ZIP codes used in estimation.
Columns (1), (3), and (5) use our baseline sample of ZIP codes, 
a fully-balanced sample dropping all data prior to July 2015, and
an unbalanced sample of ZIP codes where we control for year-of-entry by
year-month fixed effects.
While the coefficient on the residence MW is very stable across specifications,
the one on the workplace MW seems to increase slightly when using the fully-balanced
sample, and to decrease slightly under the unbalanced sample.
Our baseline sample achieves more precision at the cost of allowing the 
composition of ZIP codes to change before 2015.
We also worry that our ZIP codes might be a selected sample in ways that affect
our estimated effects.
In columns (2), (4), and (6) we estimate the same models but reweighting 
observations to match relevant characteristics of the sample of urban 
ZIP codes.%
\footnote{In particular, samples are reweighted to match the share of renter
households, the estimated share of MW residents, the share of workers aged
less then 29, and the share of workers in the ``Accomodation and Food Services''
industry.}
The re-weighting seems not to affect the estimated coefficients.

\subsection{Summary and Discussion}
\label{sec:results_discussion}

Faced with an increase of the statutory MW at some jurisdiction, our results
indicate that its sptail effect across rental markets will be determined by 
its incidence on each of the MW measures.
