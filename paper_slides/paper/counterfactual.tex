In this section, we use our results to explore the consequences of an increase
in the federal MW.
Becuase our data ends in December 2019, we study the consequences of a 
counterfactual increase in the federal minimum wage in January 2021.

% Discuss pass-through estimates. Stress that they depend on geography of prevailing
% MWs across the commmuting zone.

% Discuss welfare briefly. Maybe conjecture on long-run effects (low-wage workers 
% relocating to areas with low MW and commuting to areas with high MW).

% Discuss policy implications.

\subsection{Empirical Approach}

Following notation of the model in Section \ref{sec:model}, define the ZIP code-
specific pass-through as

\begin{equation}\label{eq:pass_through}
    \rho_i := \frac{\Delta H_i}{\Delta Y_i} 
            = \frac{H^{\text{Post}}_i R^{\text{Post}}_i - H^{\text{Pre}}_i R^{\text{Pre}}_i}{\Delta Y_i}
\end{equation}
where $H_i = \sum_{iz}\Delta H_{iz}$ denotes total rented space in $i$, 
$\text{Pre}$ and $\text{Post}$ denote moments before and after the MW change,
$R_i$ denotes rents per square foot, and 
$Y_i$ denotes total income.
