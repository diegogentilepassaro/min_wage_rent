    \noindent 
    In this paper, we estimate the effect of minimum wage policies on housing rental 
    prices. To do so, we construct a panel data set at the zipcode-month level using 
    data from Zillow and state and local minimum wage changes between 2010 to 2019. 
    Our baseline empirical approach assumes that, conditional on monthly date and zipcode 
    fixed effects, unobservable determinants of median rents are uncorrelated with past 
    and future minimum wage changes. Results indicate that increasing the minimum wage 10 
    percent is associated with an increase of between 0.25 and 0.5 percent in median rents 
    per square foot. We use several alternative empirical approaches and construct 
    falsification tests that support a causal interpretation of this estimate. We show 
    evidence that indicates the effect is driven by zipcodes where minimum wage workers 
    reside. Further heterogeneity analysis indicates that the effect is larger in zipcodes 
    with a high proportion of unemployed, African-American, and low-income households.
