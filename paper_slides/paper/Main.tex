    \noindent
    In this paper, we estimate the effect of minimum wage policies on housing rental 
    prices. We construct a panel data set at the ZIP code-month level using 
    data from Zillow, employment and wages data by industry  from the Quarterly Census of 
    Employment and Wages, and state and local minimum wage changes between 2010 to 2019. 
    Our baseline empirical approach assumes that in the short run, unobservable determinants of 
    rents are uncorrelated with past and future minimum wage changes after we condition on  
    the state of the economy, monthly date and ZIP code fixed effects.  Results indicate that increasing 
    the minimum wage by 10 percent is associated with an increase of between 0.25 and 0.5 percent in 
    median rents per square foot. We use several alternative empirical approaches and construct 
    falsification tests that support a causal interpretation of this estimate. We show 
    evidence indicating how the effect is driven by ZIP codes where minimum wage workers 
    reside. Further heterogeneity analysis indicates that the effect is larger in ZIP codes 
    with a high proportion of unemployed, African-American, and younger households. We 
    extend the analysis by creating a measure of \textit{experienced minimum wage} keeping track 
    of the difference between residence and workplace location for minimum wage earners. We 
    estimate an income-to-rent pass-through for minimum wage legislation of approximately one-third.
