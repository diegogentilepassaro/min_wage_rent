        \textit{Notes}: The table shows characteristics of four sets of U.S. postal service 
        ZIP codes. Column 1 reports demographic statistics for the universe of USPS ZIP code 
        we were able to map. Column 2 shows the same statistics for the top 100 Core-Based 
        Statistical Areas (CBSA). Column 3 shows the characteristics of the set of ZIP codes 
        available in the Zillow data. Finally, column 4 shows the restricted balanced sample 
        we use as baseline in our empirical analysis. All demographic information comes from 
        the 2010 Census and the 5-years 2008-2012 ACS.
