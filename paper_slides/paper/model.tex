In this section we lay out a simple demand and supply model of local rental 
markets.
We use the model to motivate our research design and interpret our empirical
findings.
Specifically, we obtain two results.
First, the model shows that a new MW legislation will have a different effect 
depending on whether it affects the workplace location, residence location, or 
both.
Second, the model shows that under certain conditions the effect of a MW 
policy on rents can be summarized in two MW-based measures: 
the workplace MW and the residence MW.
Derivations rely on several assumptions.
We discuss their importance and the consequences of relaxing them in the
last part of this section.

\subsection{Setup}

We consider the rental market of some ZIP code $i$ embedded in a larger geography 
composed of a finite number of ZIP codes $\Z$.
Workers with residence $i$ work in ZIP codes $z\in\Z(i)$, where 
$\Z(i)\subseteq\Z$.
We let $L_{iz}$ denote the number of $i$'s residents who work in $z$ and 
$L_i = \sum_{z \in \Z(i)} L_{iz}$ the number of residents in $i$.%
\footnote{To simplify, we assume that all of $i$' residents work, so that the 
number of residents equals the number of workers.}
Commuting shares are given by $\pi_{iz} = \frac{L_{iz}}{L_i}$.
We assume that the vector of shares $\{\pi_{iz}\}_{z\in\Z(i)}$ is fixed,
which we think is a good approximation for our empirical setting where we 
observe MW changes at a monthly frequency.%
\footnote{\textcite{AllenEtAl2020} study the within-city transmission of 
expenditure shocks by tourists within Barcelona over a period of two years.
The authors maintain an analogous assumption of constant shares of income that
each location in the city earns from every other location.}
We discuss the consequences of relaxing this assumption later in this section.

\paragraph{Minimum Wages.}

Each ZIP code has a binding nominal minimum wage.
The vector of binding MW levels relevant for $i$ is $\{\MW_z\}_{z\in\Z(i)}$.

\paragraph{Housing demand.}

Each group $(i,z)$ consumes
square feet of living space $H_{iz}$, 
a non-tradable good produced in their residence $C_{iz}^{NT}$, and
a tradable good $C_{iz}^T$.
A representative $(i,z)$ worker chooses between these alternatives by maximizing
a quasi-concave utility function 
$u_{iz} = u \left(H_{iz}, C^{\text{NT}}_{iz}, C^{\text{T}}_{iz}\right)$
subject to a budget constraint
$R_i H_{iz} + P_i(\MW_i) C^{\text{NT}}_{iz} + C^{\text{T}}_{iz} \leq Y_{iz}(\MW_z).$
In this equation 
$R_i$ gives the rental price of housing per square feet,
$P_i(\MW_i)$ gives the price of local consumption,
the price of tradable consumption is normalized to one, and 
$Y_{iz}(\MW_z)$ is an income function.
We specify the effect of MWs on these functions below.

\begin{assu}[Effect of Minimum Wages]\label{assu:mws}
    We assume that
    (i) the price of non-tradable goods is increasing in $i$'s MW, 
    $\frac{d P_i}{d \MW_i} > 0$, and
    (ii) incomes are weakly increasing in $z$'s MW, 
    $\frac{d Y_{iz}}{d \MW_z} \geq 0$, with strict inequality 
    for at least one $z\in\Z(i)$.
\end{assu}

The problem's structure, along with Assumption \ref{assu:mws}, is aligned with 
the prevailing literature.
First, \textcite{MiyauchiEtAl2021} show that individuals tend to consume close 
to home.
Consequently, it's expected that they would be sensitive to local consumption 
prices within their own neighborhoods, justifying the assumption that workers 
consume non-tradables in the same ZIP code.%
\footnote{An extension of the model would allow workers to consume in any ZIP 
    code.
    While theoretically feasible, this extension would require data on 
    consumption trips, which we lack.
    We think of our model as an approximation.}
Second, MW hikes have been shown to increase prices of local consumption 
\parencite[e.g.,][]{Leung2021},
and also to increase wage income even for wages above the MW level 
\parencite[e.g.,][]{CegnizEtAl2019, Dube2019Income}.%
\footnote{An extension would allow separate wage income and business income in 
the budget constraint.
If firm owners tend to live where they work, and MW increases damage profits
\parencite[as found by, e.g.,][]{DracaMachinVanreenen2011, HarasztosiLidner2019},
then business income would depend negatively on the MW level.}
%% SH: It would be cool to cite some paper on the relationship between consumption
%%     prices and rents.

For convenience, we define the per-capita housing demand function as 
$h_{iz} \equiv \frac{H_{iz}}{L_{iz}}$.
The solution to the worker's problem for each $z$ then yields a set of 
continuously differentiable per-capita housing demand functions 
$\{h_{iz} (R_i, P_i, Y_z)\}_{z\in\Z(i)}$.
The following assumption summarizes the properties of these functions.

\begin{assu}[Housing demand]\label{assu:housing_demand}
    Consider the set of functions $\{h_{iz} (R_i, P_i, Y_z)\}_{z\in\Z(i)}$.
    We assume that
    (i) housing is a normal good, 
    $\frac{d h_{iz}}{d Y_z} > 0$ for all $z\in\Z(i)$,
    and
    (ii) housing demand is decreasing in prices of non-tradable consumption, 
    $\frac{d h_{iz}}{d P_i} < 0$.
\end{assu}

Using the first assumption, standard arguments imply that 
$\frac{d h_{iz}}{d R_i} < 0$.
%% 
%% Specifically, normal goods rule out the possibility of rents being a Giffen good
%%
For the second assumption to hold, 
a sufficient (albeit not necessary) condition is that housing and non-tradable
consumption are complements.%
\footnote{To formalize the required condition, let $h_{iz}$ and $c_{iz}$ denote 
per-capita Marshallian demands resulting from the choice problem, and 
$\tilde h_{iz}$ denote the corresponding Hicksian housing demand.
The Slutsky equation implies that
$$\frac{\partial h_{iz}}{\partial P_i}
   = \frac{\partial \tilde h_{iz}}{\partial P_i}
   - \frac{\partial h_{iz}}{\partial Y_{iz}} c_{iz}.$$
To obtain $\frac{\partial h_{iz}}{\partial P_i} < 0$, we require that
$\frac{\partial \tilde h_{iz}}{\partial P_i}
< \frac{\partial h_{iz}}{\partial Y_{iz}} c_{iz}$, i.e., the income effect of an
increase in non-tradable prices is larger than the corresponding substitution
effect.}
While direct empirical evidence on this particular channel is lacking,
we view the evidence of workers sorting towards locations with high housing 
costs and more expensive amenities as consistent with it 
\parencite[e.g.,][]{CoutureEtAl2019}.

\paragraph{Housing supply.}

We assume that absentee landlords supply square feet in $i$ according to the 
function $S_i(R_i)$,
and we assume that this function is weakly increasing in $R_i$, 
$\frac{d S_i(R_i)}{d R_i} \ge 0$.
Note that this formulation allows for an upper limit on the number of housing 
units at which point the supply becomes perfectly inelastic.


\subsection{Equilibrium and Comparative Statics}

Total demand of housing in ZIP code $i$ is given by the sum of the demands of 
each group.
Thus, we can write the equilibrium condition in this market as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:equilibrium}
	L_i \sum_{z\in\Z(i)} \pi_{iz} h_{iz} \left(R_i, P_i(\MW_i), Y_z(\MW_z)\right) = S_i(R_i) .
\end{equation}
Given that per-capita housing demand functions are continuous and decreasing 
in rents, under a suitable regularity condition there is a unique equilibrium 
in this market.%
\footnote{To see this, assume that 
$S_i(0)/L_i - \sum_{z\in\Z(i)} \pi_{iz} h_{iz} (0, P_i, Y_z) < 0$
and apply the intermediate value theorem.
Intuitively, we require that at low rental prices per-capita demand exceeds 
per-capita supply.}
Equilibrium rents are a function of the entire set of minimum wages, formally, 
$R^*_i = f(\{\MW_i\}_{i\in\Z(i)})$.

We are interested in two questions.
First, what is the effect of a change in the vector of MWs 
$(\{d \ln \MW_i\}_{i\in\Z(i)})'$ on equilibrium rents?
Second, under what conditions can we reduce the dimensionality of the rents 
function and represent the effects of MW changes on equilibrium rents in a 
simpler way?
We start with the first question.

\begin{prop}[Comparative Statics]\label{prop:comparative_statics}
    Consider residence ZIP code $i$ and a change in MW policy at a larger
    jurisdiction such that for $z\in\Z_0 \subset \Z(i)$ binding MWs increase 
    and for $z\in\Z(i)\setminus \Z_0$ binding MWs do not change,
    where $\Z_0$ is non-empty.
    Under the assumptions of unchanging $\{\pi_{iz}\}_{z\in\Z(i)}$ 
    and Assumptions \ref{assu:mws} and \ref{assu:housing_demand},
    we have that
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[(a)]
        for any $z'\in\Z_0\setminus\{i\}$ for which $\frac{d Y_{iz'}}{d \MW_{z'}}>0$, 
        the policy has a positive partial effect on rents, 
        $\frac{d\ln R_i}{d\ln\MW_{z'}} > 0$;
        \item[(b)]
        the partial effect of the MW increase in $i$ on rents is ambiguous, 
        $\frac{d\ln R_i}{d\ln\MW_i} \lessgtr 0$; and
        \item[(c)]
        as a result, the overall effect on rents is ambiguous if $i\in\Z_0$ 
        and positive if $i\notin\Z_0$.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{prop}

Proofs are available in Online Appendix \ref{sec:proofs}.

The first part of Proposition \ref{prop:comparative_statics} shows that,
if at least some low-wage worker commutes to a ZIP code $z'$ where the MW 
increased  (so that $\frac{d Y_{iz'}}{d \MW_{z'}}>0$),
then the MW hike will tend to increase rents.
This follows from an increase in housing demand in $i$ due to the increase in
income of workers who commute to $z'$.
The second part of Proposition \ref{prop:comparative_statics} establishes that 
decreasing rents may follow if the minimum wage also increases in ZIP code $i$.
This is because the increase in $i$ lowers housing demand by a substitution
effect, so that the overall effect on rents is ambiguous.
Consequently, the sign of the overall effect of the policy in $i$ is not 
determined a priori.

As apparent from the proof of Proposition \ref{prop:comparative_statics}, 
the effect of the MW on rents at workplaces depends on the elasticities of 
per-capita housing demand to incomes
$\xi^Y_{iz} = \frac{d h_{iz}}{d Y_z} \frac{Y_z}{\sum_z \pi_{iz} h_{iz}}$ and
on the elasticities of income to minimum wages
$\epsilon_{iz}^Y = \frac{d Y_z}{d \MW_z} \frac{\MW_z}{Y_z}$.
These $(i,z)$-specific terms weigh the change in MW levels at workplaces,
and their sum over $z$ impacts rents.
The following proposition establishes conditions under which we can reduce the 
dimensionality of the rent gradient.

\begin{prop}[Representation]\label{prop:representation}
    Assume that for all ZIP codes $z\in\Z(i)$ we have
    (a) homogeneous elasticity of per-capita housing demand to incomes,
    $\xi^Y_{iz}=\xi^Y_{i}$, and
    (b) homogeneous elasticity of income to minimum wages,
    $\epsilon_{iz}^Y=\epsilon_i^Y$.
    Then, we can write
    \begin{equation} \label{eq:theory_representation}
        d r_i = \beta_i  d \mw^{\wkp}_i
              + \gamma_i d \mw^{\res}_i
    \end{equation}
    where 
    $r_{i} = \ln R_i$,
    $\mw_{i}^{\wkp} = \sum_{z\in\Z(i)} \pi_{iz} \ln \MW_z$ 
    is ZIP code $i$'s \textbf{workplace MW}, 
    $\mw^{\res}_i = \ln \MW_i$ 
    is ZIP code $i$'s \textbf{residence MW}, and 
    $\beta_i > 0$ and $\gamma_i < 0$ are parameters.
\end{prop}

Proposition \ref{prop:representation} shows that, under a homogeneity assumption
on the elasticities of per-capita housing demand to income and 
of income to the MW,%
\footnote{The assumptions stated in Proposition \ref{prop:representation} are 
actually stronger than needed.
It is enough to have that the product $\xi^Y_{iz} \epsilon_{iz}^Y$ does not vary 
by $z$.}
the change in rents following a small change in the profile of MWs can be 
expressed as a function of two MW-based measures:
one summarizing the effect of MW changes in workplaces $z\in\Z(i)$,
and another one summarizing the effect of the MW in the same ZIP code $i$.
This motivates our empirical strategy, where we regress log rents on the 
empirical counterparts of these measures.

\subsection{Summary and discussion}
\label{sec:model_summary}

Under the stated assumptions, Proposition \ref{prop:comparative_statics} shows 
that the effect of a MW increase on rents depends on whether it affects the 
ZIP code via the workplace or the residence.
ZIP codes exposed via their workplace only will tend to experience an 
increase in rents.
ZIP codes exposed to both via their workplace and residence will tend to 
experience smaller increases, or even decreases, in rents.
Controlling for the residence MW is thus important to characterize the spatial 
effects of MW policies.
Proposition \ref{prop:representation} provides guidance for the empirical
analysis of spillover effects of the MW by formally justifying the 
workplace MW, our summary measure of the changes in the MW at workplaces.

In this subsection we discuss the plausibility of the assumptions that yield 
these results and the consequences of relaxing them.

\paragraph{The mechanics of rent adjustments.}

The model is static, in the sense that everyone chooses their housing demand 
simultaneously.
Once a MW policy is enacted, a new equilibrium is reached where rents adjust
to the new demand levels to clear the market.
This adjustment takes place because workers can in principle move within ZIP 
codes, and even across ZIP codes, in search of housing that satisfies their 
demand, as long as the commuting shares remain unchanged.
\textcite{AgarwalEtAl2022} finds an increase in the probability of moving 
after a MW increase.
Online Appendix \ref{sec:dyn_theory_model} discusses an extension of the model
with discrete time periods in which the process of workers moving within the 
ZIP code to renew expiring rental contracts is modelled explicitly.
Therefore, we see that rents adjust because workers can demand more or less 
housing in response to the MW change.%
\footnote{This is a supply and demand story. 
    Another story that would yield increasing rents as response to workplace MW
    hikes is one where landlords and tenants bargain over rents, 
    and the MW improves the outside options of tenants.}

\paragraph{Homogeneity assumptions and the workplace MW.}

How likely are the assumptions that yield Proposition \ref{prop:representation}
to hold?
The assumption that the elasticity of income to the MW is constant will fail if 
the income of some $(i,z)$ groups is more sensitive to the MW than others.
This would be the case if, for example, the share of low-wage workers within 
each $\pi_{iz}$ varies strongly by workplace.
% \footnote{For instance, say that 
% $$ Y_z = \underline{L}_{iz} \MW_z + \left(L_{iz} - \underline{L}_{iz}\right) \overline{W}_z $$
% where $\underline{L}_{iz}$ is the number of MW workers in the flow $L_{iz}$, 
% and $\overline{W}_z$ is the average wage earned by non-MW workers.
% In this case we have
% $\epsilon^Y_z = (\MW_z\underline{L}_{iz}/Y_z) ,$
% so if $\underline{L}_{iz}$ is constant the assumption will hold.}
The assumption that the elasticity of housing demand to income is constant 
will hold trivially for preferences
$h_{iz} = g\left(R_i, P_i\right) Y_i$ for some $g\left(\cdot\right)$, such as 
those in Cobb-Douglas or Constant Elasticity of Substitution utility functions.
However, one would expect the elasticity of $(i,z)$ groups with many low-wage 
workers to be larger, suggesting that this type of preferences may not be 
appropriate.

We thus see that the homogeneity assumptions are strong and will likely not hold 
exactly.
However, we expect our empirical model based on Proposition 
\ref{prop:representation} to offer a reasonable approximation to study the 
spillover effects of MW policies on the housing market.
In fact, unless the heterogeneity in $\{\xi_{iz}^Y\epsilon_{iz}^Y\}_{z\in\Z(i)}$ 
has a strongly asymmetric distribution across workplace locations, we expect to 
correctly capture the average contribution of the workplace MW on rents.
In other words, the value of $\beta_i  d \mw^{\wkp}_i$ is likely to be close 
to the value of the elasticity-weighted changes in workplace MW levels that, 
according to the model, determine rents.%
\footnote{More precisely, say that 
    $\xi^Y_{iz}\epsilon_{iz}^Y = \overline{\xi\epsilon}_i + \nu_{iz}$ where 
    $\nu_{iz}$ has a mean of zero.
    In that case, a similar logic than the one in the proof of Proposition 
    \ref{prop:representation} will result in the following expression for 
    rents changes:
    $$
        d r_i = \gamma_i d \mw^{\res}_i
            + \frac{\overline{\xi\epsilon}_i}
                    {\eta_{i} - \sum_z \pi_{iz} \xi_{iz}^R} \sum_z d\ln \MW_z
            + \frac{1}
                    {\eta_{i} - \sum_z \pi_{iz} \xi_{iz}^R} \sum_z \nu_{iz} d\ln \MW_z .
    $$
    The second term on the right-hand side is equivalent to $\beta_i \mw_{i}^{\wkp}$
    in Proposition \ref{prop:representation}.
    The third term reflects the heterogeneity.
    If $\nu_{iz}$ has a symmetric distribution, and $d\ln \MW_z$ is the same across 
    workplaces (because it originates from a single jurisdiction), then this third 
    term will equal zero.}
Moreover, in our empirical exercises we allow for heterogeneity in elasticities
based on observable characteristics of workers, 
such as the share of MW workers residing in each location, empirically 
exploring this channel.

\paragraph{Representation under changing commuting shares.} 

Online Appendix \ref{sec:model_endogenous_shares} discusses the consequences
of relaxing the assumption of fixed commuting shares.
In particular, we assume that the commuting shares are declining in the MW level
at the workplace \parencite[as found by, e.g.,][]{PerezPerez2021}.
In this case, Proposition \ref{prop:representation_endog_shares} in the online
appendix shows that MW hikes at workplace locations will affect rents through 
two channels:
a positive channel via increases in housing demand, and
a negative channel via decreases in commuting shares.
Therefore, potential declines in commuting shares at the month of the MW change 
will tend to attenuate the positive effect of the workplace MW on rents, biasing 
our estimates towards not finding an effect.
Alternatively, if one thinks that commuting shares adjust more slowly than
posted rental prices, then an increase in the workplace MW will tend to
lower rents after the MW change.
We do not find evidence of this in our estimates, suggesting that the assumption
of fixed commuting shares when focusing on monthly changes in rents is
reasonable.
