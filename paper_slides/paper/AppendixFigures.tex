		\textit{Notes}: The figure show estimates for $\hat{\beta}_{r}$ obtained from 
		\autoref{eq:leads_lags} when progressively adding time-varying controls for local shocks. 
		The \textit{baseline} series plots coefficients taken from 
		\autoref{tab:dynamic_leads_lags_econshock}, column (1). The \textit{employment}, 
		\textit{establishment}, \textit{wage}, and \textit{building} series plot coefficients 
		from \autoref{tab:dynamic_leads_lags_econshock}, columns (2) to (5) respectively. 90 
		percent confidence intervals reported.
