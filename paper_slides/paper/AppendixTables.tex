		\textit{Notes}: The table shows estimates for the cumulative impact of MW (log) changes 
		on (log) rents changes over 6 months. Coefficients are obtained by taking the sum of 
		$\hat{\beta}_{r}$, estimated via \autoref{eq:lags}: $\sum\limits_{r=0}^{5} \hat{\beta}_{r}$. 
		Standard errors clustered at the state level. *** $p < 0.01$, ** $p < 0.05$, * $p < 0.1$.

			\textit{Notes}: The table presents baseline estimates obtained from \autoref{eq:did}, 
			(\ref{eq:leads_lags}), and (\ref{eq:lags}) in columns (1), (2), and (3) respectively. 
			Column (4) allows for rental price dynamics by adding the lagged change in (log) rents, 
			$\Delta y_{i(t-1)}$, and it is estimated instrumenting it with a deeper lag $\Delta 
			y_{i(t-2)}$ \parencite{arellano1991some}. Similarly, column (5) solves for 
			\autoref{eq:ab_panel} where only lags of MW changes are allowed. Finally, columns (6) and 
			(7) instrument $\Delta y_{i(t-1)}$ with an off-window lag of the MW (log) change, $\Delta 
			\title{MW}_{i(t-6)}$ for the leads and lags, and lags only versions of the model. All 
			specifications additionally control for a zipcode-level linear trend. Standard errors 
			clustered at the state level. *** $p < 0.01$, ** $p < 0.05$, * $p < 0.1$.

		\textit{Notes}: The table compares estimates from our main specifications (\textit{static DiD}, 
		\textit{distributed leads and lags DiD}, and \textit{distributed lags DiD}) obtained using the 
		baseline sample with estimates obtained using the unbalanced, full sample of zipcodes. Columns 
		(1), (2), and (3) show results from from \autoref{eq:did}, (\ref{eq:leads_lags}), and (\ref{eq:lags}) 
		respectively, using the unbalanced sample. All three columns additionally control for ``cohort 
		$\times$ period" FE to account for differences in the each zipcodes time series. Columns (4), (5), 
		and (6) replicates our main results obtained with the baseline sample and presented in 
		\autoref{tab: did_main}, column (2), \autoref{tab: dynamic_lags_leads_main}, column (2) and
