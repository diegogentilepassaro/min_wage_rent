In this paper, we ask whether minimum wage changes affect housing rental prices. To answer this 
question we use rental listings from Zillow and MW changes collected from 
\textcite{VaghulZipperer2016}, \textcite{CegnizEtAl2019} and our ourselves, to construct a panel 
at the ZIP code-month level. The high frequency and resolution of our data allows us to analyze state, 
county, and city-level changes in the MW to identify the causal impact of raising the MW on the 
local rental housing market. To do that, we leverage on a panel difference-in-differences approach that 
exploits the staggered implementation and the intensity of hundreds of MW increases 
across thousands of ZIP codes. Our results indicate that minimum wage increases have a small but 
significant positive impact on rents, and that is robust to many alternative explanations. Across most 
specifications, a $10\%$ percent increase in MW causes rents to increase approximately by $0.26 \%$ percent. 
The effect is largely concentrated in the first two months of the MW change. We go 
beyond the average MW effect and we look at the heterogeneity of effects across ZIP codes. We show 
that rents disproportionately increase in ZIP codes where: (i) it is more likely to find MW workers as 
residents; (ii) there is a lower share of college graduates;  (iii) a larger share of younger residents (15-24 yers old);   
and (iii) a larger share of African-American 
residents. We then leverage LODES data to create a measure of experienced MW that accounts for the difference 
between residence and workplace location for minimum wage earners. We are able in this way to better track the 
changes in MW that residents of different ZIP codes experience, and to recover the estimated effect of MW on rents 
more precisely ($0.031$, s.e. $0.013$). To assess the magnitude of the effect of MW on housing rents, we perform 
benchmarking exercises to recover the income-to-rent pass-through associated with the causal estimates. 
We use both QCEW county-quarter wage data, and results from \textcite{CegnizEtAl2019} to first 
recover the average wage elasticity to the MW used to obtain compute the pass-through. All exercises 
consistently show that a share approximately between $19$ and $28$ percent of the additional income 
generated by MW policies end up captured by landlords via-rents.
Our results highlights that place-based policies aimed at the labor market can also have 
significant impacts on other related markets. In particular, MW provisions are usually thought as a 
way to guarantee economic means to low income workers but they may also be benefiting landlords in 
ways that are unintended. In this sense, studying how place-based policies affect the housing market 
becomes an important step to better understand income inequality across U.S. neighborhoods.
