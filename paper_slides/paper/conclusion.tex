In this paper, we ask whether minimum wage changes affect housing rental prices. To answer this 
question we use rental listings from Zillow and MW changes collected from 
\textcite{VaghulZipperer2016} and \textcite{BerkeleyLaborCenter}, to construct a panel 
at the ZIP code-month level. The high frequency and resolution of our data allows us to analyze state, 
county, and city-level changes in the MW to identify the causal impact of raising the MW on the 
local rental housing market.
