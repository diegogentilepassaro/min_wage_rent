\section{A dynamic supply and demand model}\label{sec:dyn_theory_model}

The geography is represented by a set of ZIP codes $\Z$.
There is an exogenous given distribution of people with differing residence $i$ and 
workplace $z$ locations across these ZIP codes which,
as in the main body of the paper, we denote by $\{L_{iz}\}_{i,z\in\Z\times\Z}$.

Let $H_{it}$ be the stock of square feet rented in period $t$, where $t$ is 
characterized by a month $m$ and year $y$.
This stock is composed of contracts starting at different calendar months. 
We assume that all contracts last for one year.
We impose that that $H_{it} \leq D_i$ for all $t$, where $D_i$ denotes the total 
number of available square feet in ZIP code $i$.

We further decompose $H_{it}$ as follows. 
Let $h_{izt} = h_{iz}\left(r_{it}, \MW_{it}, \MW_{zt}\right)$ be the 
per-person demand of housing of group $(i,z)$ in period $t$,
which depends on the prevailing MW at the time of contract sign-up.
Let $\lambda_{it}$ denote the share of $i$'s residents who started their contracts 
in period $t$.%
\footnote{For simplicity, we assume that these shares don't vary by workplace.}
Then, we can write
$$
H_{it} = \sum_{\tau = t - 11}^t \lambda_{i\tau} \sum_{z\in\Z} L_{iz} 
h_{iz\tau} (r_{i\tau}, \MW_{i\tau}, \MW_{z\tau})
$$
where 
$r_{it}$ represents rents \textit{per square foot} in period $t$. 
We assume that all square feet are homogeneous and so they have the same price in 
the market.

\subsection*{Within-period equilibrium}

Within this simple model, we assume the following timing: 
(1) A share $\lambda_{it}$ of people's contracts expire (the ones who started 12 
month ago);
(2) The square feet from expiring contracts are added to the pool of available 
rental space;
(3) Renters in $t$ and a flow supply of rental space in $t$ determine equilibrium 
rents $r_{it}$.
Let's go by these steps more formally.

In every period, $\lambda_{it} L_{iz} h_{iz,t-12}$ square feet become available 
for rent from each group of workers $(i,z)$.
The square feet available to rent in period $t$ (vacant) are then
$$
\lambda_{it} \sum_z L_{iz} h_{iz,t-12} + \mathds{1}{\left\{H_{it} < D_i\right\}} 
(D_i - H_{it})
$$
where $\mathds{1}\{\cdot\}$ is the indicator function.
We denote by $V_{it}(r_{it}, \lambda_t)$ the supply of housing, increasing in 
$r_{it}$.
A feasilibity constraint is that 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:feasibility}
	V_{it}(r_{it}, \lambda_t) \leq \lambda_t \sum_z L_{iz} h_{iz,t-12} + 
	\mathds{1}_{\left\{H_{it} < D_i\right\}} (D_i - H_{it})
\end{equation}
The flow demand for new rentals in $t$ by those whose contract expired is given by
$$
\lambda_{it} \sum_z L_{iz} h_{izt} \left(r_{it}, \MW_{it}, \MW_{zt} \right)
$$
This demand arises because a share of the ZIP code's contracts expired. 
Those people go to the market and may desire to rent more square feet given changes 
in their income.

The market in period $t$ cleans if $\lambda_{it} \sum_z L_{iz} h_{izt} = V_{it}$.
Dividing by the number of workers in the ZIP code $L_i$ we can write this condition 
in per-capita terms:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:equilibrium_dynamic}
	\lambda_t \sum_z \pi_{iz} h_{iz} \left(r_{it}, \MW_{it}, \MW_{zt} \right) = 
	v_{it}(r_{it}, \lambda_t)
\end{equation}
where $v_{it} = \frac{V_{it}}{L_{i}}$.

Given minimum wages $\{\MW_{it}\}_{i\in\Z}$, share of workers looking to rent in 
period $t$, $\lambda_t$, and a number of vacancies that satisfies 
\eqref{eq:feasibility}, equation \eqref{eq:equilibrium_dynamic} determines equilibrium 
rents in period $t$.
This condition has the same properties as equation \eqref{eq:equilibrium} in the 
main.
Thus, an analogue of Propositions \ref{prop:comparative_statics} and \ref{prop:representation}
hold.

\section{The Rationale for Selecting Economic Controls}\label{sec:app_econ_control}

Throughout the paper we use wages, employment, and establishment-count from the QCEW to control 
for the local business cycle. However, those variables may themselves be impacted directly by 
changes in the MW. As a result, incorporating those controls raises the concern of a ``bad 
control'' problem \parencite{AngristPischke2009}. In the scenario that the MW affects the 
controls used in the regression, this approach will not unveil the average treatment effect of 
the MW on rents even if the policy is known to be \textit{randomly assigned}. The reason is 
that conditioning on these variables opens a potential alternative channel through which the MW 
affects rents, introducing bias in our estimates.

To avoid the ``bad controls" problem, while at the same time include control variables that 
proxy for the local economic conditions, we select QCEW county-level time-series for the sectors 
that we think are unlikely to be affected by MW legislation: "Professional and Business Services", 
"Information", and "Finance". Our interpretation of the effects of the MW on rents as causal 
relies on the assumption that these controls are not influenced by the MW. In this appendix we 
provide evidence in favor of this assumption.

We start by noting that these sectors employ a rather small portion of MW labor. According to 
\textcite[][table 5]{MinWorkersReportBLS}, in 2019 such industries accounted for 3.5, 1, and 
1.2 percent of the total number of MW workers, respectively. These low percentages make direct
impacts unlikely. However, these sectors may be influenced by MW legislation indirectly. We 
test this possibility by using a version of the dynamic model to analyze whether MW affects 
either wages, employment, or establishment-count in these sectors. The presence of significant 
pre-treatment trends would suggest that these sectors react to MW, and cast doubt on the 
identification strategy discussed in the paper.

For each industry, we observe employment at the county and month levels, and average weekly 
wages and establishment-count at the county and quarter levels. As a result, estimation of the 
dynamic model defined at the zipcode and month level is not straightforward. To be able to 
estimate our model, we aggregate MW zipcode-month information at the county-month level by 
taking, for each period, the weighted average of MW levels in each zipcode associated with a 
given county, using the number of housing units as weights. We call this our MW variable 
$\underline{w}_{ct}$, where $(c, t)$ is a county and monthly date cell.\footnote{For counties 
	without city level ordinances this procedure would simply reflect the state- or 
	county-level 	MW. For places with a MW at the city level our MW variable corresponds to a 
	weighted average between places affected by the city MW and places not affected by it.}

Given that we observe employment with monthly frequency, we are able to estimate the following 
model:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:dynamic_econ_cont_month}
\Delta \ln y_{ct} = \delta_{t} 
+ \sum_{r=-s}^{s} \beta_r \Delta \ln \underline{w}_{c,t+r} 
+ \Delta \nu_{ct} ,
\end{equation}
where $y_{ct}$ is the outcome variable (employment) in county $c$ and month $t$, and $s$ defines 
the number of leads and lags in the model.

Because the QCEW provides average weekly wages and establishment-count at the county-quarter level, 
we estimate the model for these variables in quarterly averages of monthly observations. We compute 
quarterly average of QCEW measures as $\overline{\Delta y}_{cq} = \frac{1}{3} \Delta y_{cq}$. As for 
MW data, we define $\underline{w}_{cq}$ as the third month in each quarter $q$. We are then able to 
compute the quarterly average for MW changes, $\overline{\Delta \ln \underline{w}}_{cq} = \frac{1}{3} 
\Delta \ln \underline{w}_{cq}$. The estimating model then becomes

\begin{equation} \label{eq:dynamic_econ_cont_quarter}
\overline{\Delta \ln y}_{cq} = \overline{\delta}_q 
+ \sum_{r=\tau}^{\tau} \rho_r \overline{\Delta \ln \underline{w}}_{c,q+r}
+ \overline{\Delta \nu}_{ct} ,
\end{equation}
where $\tau$ defines the quarterly window. We interpret the $\rho_r$ coefficients in 
\autoref{eq:dynamic_econ_cont_quarter} as averages of the monthly coefficients $\beta_r$ in 
\autoref{eq:dynamic_econ_cont_month}. The reason is that the average change over a quarter is a 
linear combination of monthly changes.\footnote{To see this, let's define $q_1, q_2, q_3$ as the 
	first, second, and third months in a quarter $q$, respectively. Then, for any variable $x$,
	\begin{equation*}
	\begin{split}
	\frac{1}{3}\Delta x_{cq} 
	& = \frac{1}{3} \left( x_{cq} - x_{c,q-1} \right) 
	= \frac{1}{3} \left( x_{cq_3} - x_{c,q_3-1} \right) \\
	& = \frac{1}{3} \left( x_{cq_3} - x_{cq_2} 
	+ x_{cq_2} - x_{cq_1} + x_{cq_1} - x_{c,q_3-1} \right) \\ 
	& = \frac{1}{3} \left( \Delta x_{cq_3} + \Delta x_{cq_2}  + \Delta x_{cq_1} \right) .
	\end{split}
	\end{equation*}}

\autoref{fig:controls_models} shows the results of our estimation for the three industries 
selected as controls. Even though some of the coefficients are significant, we interpret the 
results as suggestive of a noisy zero effect. The most worrisome sector is ``Professional 
and Business Services'', which shows a significant same quarter coefficient of average weekly
wages, and a slight negative pre-trend in employment. While we decided to keep this sector as
control in our main models, we stress that our results are virtually identical when dropping it.
