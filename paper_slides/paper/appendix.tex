\section{The Rationale for Selecting Economic Controls}\label{sec:app_econ_control}

In most empirical specifications presented in the paper, we use wages, employment and 
establishment count from the QCEW to control for the local business cycle. However, those 
variables may themselvesbe impacted directly by changes in the MW. As a result, incorporating 
those controls raises the concern of a ``bad control'' problem \parencite{AngristPischke2009}. 
In the scenario that the MW affects the controls used in the regression, this approach will 
not unveil the average treatment effect of the MW on rents even if the policy is known to be 
\textit{randomly assigned}. The reason is that conditioning on these variables opens a 
potential alternative channel through which the MW affects rents, introducing bias in our 
estimates.

To avoid the ``bad controls" problem, while at the same time include control variables that 
proxy for the local economic conditions, we select QCEW county-level time-series for the sectors 
that we think are unlikely to be affected by MW legislation: "Professional and Business Services", 
"Information", and "Finance". Our interpretation of the effects of the MW on rents as causal 
relies on the assumption that these controls are not influenced by the MW. In this appendix we 
provide evidence in favor of this assumption.

We start by noting that these sectors employ a very small portion of MW labor. According to 
\textcite[][table 5]{MinWorkersReportBLS}, in 2019 such industries accounted for, 3.5, 1, and 
1.2 percent of the total number of MW workers, respectively. These low percentages make direct
impacts unlikely. However, these sectors may be influenced by MW legislation indirectly. We 
test this possibility by using a version of the dynamic model to analyze whether there is an 
effect of MW changes on either of wages, employment, on establishment-count in these sectors.
The presence of significant pre-treatment trends would suggest that these sectors react to MW, 
and thus will cast doubt on the identification strategy discussed in 
\autoref{sec:empirical_strategy}. 

For each industry, we observe employment at the county and month levels, and average weekly wages 
and establishment-count at the county and quarter levels. As a result, estimation of the dynamic 
model defined at the zipcode and month level is not straightforward. To be able to estimate our 
model, we aggregate MW zipcode-month information at the county-month level by taking, for each 
period, the weighted average of MW levels in each zipcode associated with a given county, using 
the number of housing units as weights. We call this our MW variable $\underline{w}_{ct}$, where 
$(c, t)$ is a county and monthly date cell.\footnote{For counties without city-level ordinances 
	this procedure would simply reflect the state- or county-level MW. For places with a MW at 
	the city level our MW variable corresponds to an weighted average between places affected by 
	the city MW and places not affected by it.}

Given that we observe employment with monthly frequency, we are able to estimate the following 
model:

\begin{equation} \label{eq:dynamic_econ_cont_month}
	\Delta \ln y_{ct} = \delta_{t} 
					+ \sum_{r=-s}^{s} \beta_r \Delta \ln \underline{w}_{c,t+r} 
					+ \Delta \nu_{ct} ,
\end{equation}
where $y_{ct}$ is the outcome variable in county $c$ and month $t$, and $s$ defines the number
of leads and lags in the model. As for wages and establishment-count, the data is aggregated at 
the county-quarter level. We therefore estimate the model in averages. Define the quarterly 
average of a variable $x$ as $\overline{\Delta x}_{cq} = \frac{1}{3} \Delta x_{cq}$. The 
estimating model is

\begin{equation} \label{eq:dynamic_econ_cont_quarter}
	\overline{\Delta \ln y}_{cq} = \overline{\delta}_q 
				+ \sum_{r=-s/3}^{s/3} \rho_r \overline{\Delta \ln \underline{w}}_{c,q+r} 
				+ \overline{\Delta \nu}_{ct}
\end{equation}
where $q$ represents the quarter. 

Notice that estimating \autoref{eq:dynamic_econ_cont_month} 
and \autoref{eq:dynamic_econ_cont_quarter} is equivalent because the average change over a quarter is a linear combination of 
monthly changes.

%We focus on the supply and demand of housing in a given zipcode. Consider an environment with 
%an exogenously given continuum of households in each zipcode divided in two groups: minimum wage 
%and non-minimum wage households (HH). The former are fully affected by the MW, whereas the latter 
%are not affected at all.
%
%On the supply side, we denote by $H$ the continuous measure of housing units available for rent 
%in the zipcode. We assume that units are homogeneous, and can be rented at the a rent of $r$. The 
%supply of housing $H(r)$ is assumed to be increasing in rents $r$, so that $H'(r) > 0$.
%
%Let us move to the demand side. Households receive monthly a income, which we denote by 
%$\underline{w}$ and $w$ for MW HH and non-MW households, respectively. Demand for housing is given 
%by $\underline{H}(r, \underline{w})$ and $\overline{H}(r, w)$ for each household type. We make two 
%standard assumptions on these objects: (i) the demand of housing is downward sloping (i.e., 
%$\underline{H}_r(r, \underline{w}) < 0$ and $\overline{H}_r(r, w) < 0$); and (ii) the demand for 
%housing is increasing in income (i.e., $\underline{H}_w(r, \underline{w}) > 0$ and $\overline{H}_w(r, 
%w) > 0$)
%

%\subsection{Equilibrium and the elasticity of rents to the minimum wage}
%
%Equilibrium rents $r^*$ are such that local housing supply is equated to local housing demand. 
%Formally,
%
%\begin{equation*}\label{eq:model-eq}
%H(r) =  \underline{H}(r, \underline{w}) + \overline{H}(r, w) \ .
%\end{equation*}
%
%We are interested in the elasticity of equilibrium rents $r^*$ to the minimum wage $\underline{w}$, 
%which we denote by $\rho$. The implicit function theorem applied on the above equation yields
%
%\begin{equation}\label{eq:model-elasticity}
%\rho := \frac{d \ln r^*}{d \ln \underline{w}} 
%= \frac{\underline{w} \ \underline{H}_w}
%{r\  H'(r) - r \ \underline{H}_r - r \ \overline{H}_r} \ ,
%\end{equation}
%where we denote partial derivatives with sub-indexes.
%
%Note that, since $\underline{H}_r < 0$ and $\overline{H}_r < 0$, the above expression is always 
%positive. When the MW increases the local housing market moves to a new equilibrium with higher 
%rents. The magnitude of the elasticity is driven by the relative magnitudes of the earnings of 
%minimum wage workers ($\overline{w}$) and rents ($r$), and the slopes of the different 
%functions in equilibrium. For instance, a higher response of housing demand to the minimum wage 
%change ($\underline{H}_w$) would result in a higher elasticity.
