\section{A Direct test of the Impact of Minimum Wage on Time-Varying Economic Controls}\label{sec:app_econ_control}
In all the model specifications presented in the paper, we use county-level data from the QCEW 
to control for the local business cycle. However, a potential concern in using local 
economy data may arise if changes in the MW have a \textit{direct} impact on such quantities. This 
would lead the treated and control group be systematically different \parencite{AngristPischke2009}. 

To avoid the ``bad controls" problem, while at the same time including control variables that truly proxy for the 
local economic conditions, we select QCEW county-level time-series for the following industries: "Professional 
and Business Services"; "Information"; and "Finance". According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), 
in 2019 such industries accounted for $3.5$, $1$, and $1.2$ percent of the total MW workers respectively, making them 
unlikely to be direcly impacted by MW legislation.\footnote{See the 2020 BLS report on minimum wage workers.} For each 
industry, we observe county-month employment, and county-quarter average weekly wages and establishment count. 

To provide further evidence on the chosen controls' validity, we use them as left-hand side variable in a dynamic DiD
model. The presence of significant pre-treatment trends would suggest how MW react to local economic shocks and
cast doubts on the identification strategy introduced in \autoref{sec:empirical_strategy}. 

QCEW data are aggregated at the county-level, hence preventing us to estimate \autoref{eq:leads_lags}. We therefore 
aggregate MW zipcode-month information at the county-month level by taking, for each period, 
the weighted average of MW levels in each zipcode associated with a given county, using the number of housing units 
as weights. For counties without city-level ordinances, this would simply reflect the state- or county-level MW. Since 
QCEW provides county-month employment data, we are able to estimate the following regression model: 

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:dynamic_econ_cont_month}
	\Delta y_{ct} = \delta_{t} + \sum\limits_{r=-s}^{s} \beta_r \Delta \underline{w}_{c,t+r} + \Delta \nu_{ct}
\end{equation}

where $y_{ct}$ is the (log) employment in county $c$ in month $t$. The exogeneity 
assumption requires that  $E \left[ \Delta \nu_{ct} | \delta_t, \{ \Delta \underline{w}_{c,t+r} \} \forall r \right] =  0$ 

As for wages and establishment count, the data
is aggregated at the county-quarter level. We hence estimate the impact of the average MW change in a quarter 
over the average rent change. This amounts to running the following regression: 

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:dynamic_econ_cont_quarter}
	\overline{\Delta y}_{cq} = \overline{\delta}_q +  \sum\limits_{r=-s}^{s} \rho_r \overline{\Delta \underline{w}}_{c,q+r} + \overline{\Delta \nu}_{ct}
\end{equation}

where $\overline{\Delta x}_{cq} = \frac{1}{3} \Delta x_{cq}$ (the quarterly average). Notice that estimating \autoref{eq:dynamic_econ_cont_month} 
and \autoref{eq:dynamic_econ_cont_quarter} is equivalent because the average change over a quarter is a linear combination of 
monthly changes.

\section{A toy model of the local housing market}\label{sec:model}

We build a simple model that is used to build a benchmark estimate of the effect of MW
policies on rents.

\subsection{Model set-up}

We focus on the supply and demand of housing in a given zipcode. Consider an environment with 
an exogenously given continuum of households in each zipcode divided in two groups: minimum wage 
and non-minimum wage households (HH). The former are fully affected by the MW, whereas the latter 
are not affected at all.

On the supply side, we denote by $H$ the continuous measure of housing units available for rent 
in the zipcode. We assume that units are homogeneous, and can be rented at the a rent of $r$. The 
supply of housing $H(r)$ is assumed to be increasing in rents $r$, so that $H'(r) > 0$.

Let us move to the demand side. Households receive monthly a income, which we denote by 
$\underline{w}$ and $w$ for MW HH and non-MW households, respectively. Demand for housing is given 
by $\underline{H}(r, \underline{w})$ and $\overline{H}(r, w)$ for each household type. We make two 
standard assumptions on these objects: (i) the demand of housing is downward sloping (i.e., 
$\underline{H}_r(r, \underline{w}) < 0$ and $\overline{H}_r(r, w) < 0$); and (ii) the demand for 
housing is increasing in income (i.e., $\underline{H}_w(r, \underline{w}) > 0$ and $\overline{H}_w(r, 
w) > 0$)


\subsection{Equilibrium and the elasticity of rents to the minimum wage}

Equilibrium rents $r^*$ are such that local housing supply is equated to local housing demand. 
Formally,

\begin{equation*}\label{eq:model-eq}
H(r) =  \underline{H}(r, \underline{w}) + \overline{H}(r, w) \ .
\end{equation*}

We are interested in the elasticity of equilibrium rents $r^*$ to the minimum wage $\underline{w}$, 
which we denote by $\rho$. The implicit function theorem applied on the above equation yields

\begin{equation}\label{eq:model-elasticity}
\rho := \frac{d \ln r^*}{d \ln \underline{w}} 
= \frac{\underline{w} \ \underline{H}_w}
{r\  H'(r) - r \ \underline{H}_r - r \ \overline{H}_r} \ ,
\end{equation}
where we denote partial derivatives with sub-indexes.

Note that, since $\underline{H}_r < 0$ and $\overline{H}_r < 0$, the above expression is always 
positive. When the MW increases the local housing market moves to a new equilibrium with higher 
rents. The magnitude of the elasticity is driven by the relative magnitudes of the earnings of 
minimum wage workers ($\overline{w}$) and rents ($r$), and the slopes of the different 
functions in equilibrium. For instance, a higher response of housing demand to the minimum wage 
change ($\underline{H}_w$) would result in a higher elasticity.
