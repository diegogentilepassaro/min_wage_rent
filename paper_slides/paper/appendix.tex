\section{A dynamic supply and demand model}\label{sec:dyn_theory_model}

The geography is represented by a set of ZIP codes $\Z$.
There is an exogenously given distribution of people with differing 
residence $i$ and 
workplace $z$ locations across these ZIP codes which,
as in the main body of the paper, we denote by $\{L_{iz}\}_{i,z\in\Z\times\Z}$.

Let $H_{it}$ be the stock of square feet rented in period $t$, where $t$ is 
characterized by a month $m$ and year $y$.
This stock is composed of contracts starting at different calendar months. 
We assume that all contracts last for one year.
We impose that that $H_{it} \leq D_i$ for all $t$, 
where $D_i$ denotes the total number of available square feet in $i$.

We further decompose $H_{it}$ as follows.
Let $h_{izt} = h_{iz}\left(R_{it}, \MW_{it}, \MW_{zt}\right)$ be the 
per-person demand of housing of group $(i,z)$ in period $t$,
which depends on the prevailing MW at the time of contract sign-up.
We assume that this demand function is decreasing in residence MW and decreasing
in workplace MW, just as in Section \ref{sec:model}.
For simplicity we omitted the mediation channels of prices and income.
Let $\lambda_{it}$ denote the share of $i$'s residents who started their contracts 
in period $t$.%
\footnote{We assume that these shares do not vary by workplace.}
Then, we can write the stock of contracted square feet during period $t$ as
$$
H_{it} = \sum_{\tau = t - 11}^{t} \lambda_{i\tau} \sum_{z\in\Z} L_{iz} 
h_{iz\tau} (r_{i\tau}, \MW_{i\tau}, \MW_{z\tau})
$$
where 
$r_{i\tau}$ represents rents \textit{per square foot} in period $\tau$.
It is convenient to define the stock of contracted square feet excluding the ones 
that were signed 12 months ago. We denote them by
$$
\tilde H_{it} = \sum_{\tau = t - 10}^{t} \lambda_{i\tau} \sum_{z\in\Z} L_{iz} 
h_{iz\tau} (r_{i\tau}, \MW_{i\tau}, \MW_{z\tau}) .
$$

We assume that all square feet are homogeneous and so they have the same price in 
the market.

\subsection*{Within-period equilibrium}

Within this simple model, we assume the following timing: 
(1) At the beginning of period $t$, a share $\lambda_{it}$ of people's contracts 
expire (the ones that started on $t-12$);
(2) The square feet from expiring contracts are added to the pool of available 
rental space for new renters;
(3) Renters in $t$ and a flow supply of rental space in $t$ determine equilibrium 
rents $R_{it}$.
Let's go by these steps more formally.

As of the start of every period $t$, $\lambda_{i,t-12} \sum_z L_{iz} h_{iz,t-12}$ 
square feet become available for rent from each group of workers $(i,z)$.
The square feet available to rent in period $t$ (vacant) are then
$$
\lambda_{i,t-12} \sum_z L_{iz} h_{iz,t-12} + (D_i - H_{i,t-1}) = D_i - \tilde H_{i,t-1}.
$$
Note that $(D_i - H_{i,t-1})$ are the non-rented square feet as of $t-1$.

We denote by $V_{it}(R_{it}, \lambda_t)$ the supply of housing, increasing in 
$R_{it}$.
A feasilibity constraint is that 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:feasibility}
    V_{it}(R_{it}, \lambda_t) \leq D_i - \tilde H_{i,t-1} .
\end{equation}

The flow demand for new rentals in $t$ by those whose contract expired is given by
$$
\lambda_{it} \sum_z L_{iz} h_{izt} \left(R_{it}, \MW_{it}, \MW_{zt} \right) .
$$
This demand arises because a share of the ZIP code's contracts expired. 
Those people go to the market and may desire to rent more square feet given changes 
in their income.

The market in period $t$ cleans if
\begin{equation}\label{eq:equilibrium_dynamic}
    \lambda_t \sum_z L_{iz} h_{iz} \left(R_{it}, \MW_{it}, \MW_{zt} \right) = 
    V_{it}(R_{it}, \lambda_t) .
\end{equation}
Given minimum wages in $t$, $\{\MW_{it}\}_{i\in\Z}$,
the share of workers looking to rent in period $t$, $\lambda_t$, 
and a number of vacancies that satisfies \eqref{eq:feasibility}, 
equation \eqref{eq:equilibrium_dynamic} determines equilibrium rents in period $t$.
Because the properties of housing demand and housing supply are the same as in the
model in Section \ref{sec:model},
the equilibrium condition \eqref{eq:equilibrium_dynamic} implies an analogue of 
Propositions \ref{prop:comparative_statics} and \ref{prop:representation}.

\section{Matching census blocks to USPS ZIP codes}
\label{sec:blocks_to_uspszip}

One challenge of this project is that LODES data on commuting patterns are 
aggregated at the census-block level of the 2010 US Census.
However, Zillow data are aggregated at the level of \textit{USPS ZIP codes},
and census blocks and USPS ZIP codes are not nested.
In this appendix we describe the steps we took to construct a correspondence
table between these geographies.

First, we collected the GIS map of 11,053,116 census blocks from \textcite{cbTiger}
and compute their centroids.
Second, we assigned each block to a unique USPS ZIP code using the GIS map 
from \textcite{ESRI} based on assigning to each block the USPS ZIP code 
that contains its centroid.
If the centroid falls outside of the block, we pick a point inside it at random.
We assign 11,013,203 using the spatial match (99.64 percent of the total).%
\footnote{545,566 of ZIP codes assigned via spatial match use 
a point of the census block picked at random (4.94 percent of the total).}
Third, for the blocks that remain unassigned we use the 
tract-to-USPS-ZIP-code correspondence from \textcite{hudCrosswalks}.
Specifically, for each tract we keep the USPS ZIP code where the largest number 
of houses of the tract fall, and we assign it to each block using the tract 
identifier.
We assign 22,819 blocks using this approach (0.21 percent).
There remain 17,094 unassigned blocks (0.15 percent), which we drop from the 
analysis.
This creates a unique mapping from census blocks to USPS ZIP codes.

In the end, there are 11,036,022 census blocks which are assigned to 31,754 
USPS ZIP codes, implying an average of 347.55 census blocks per ZIP code.
Thus, even though there may be blocks that go beyond one ZIP code, 
we expect the error introduced by this process to be very small.

\section{Identification of first-differenced model with spillovers}
\label{sec:did_spillovers_id}

Consider the causal model for rents given by
$$r_{it}=f_{it}(\{\mw_{zt}\}_{z\in\Z})$$
where $\mw_{zt}$ represents the ``dose'' of treatment received by unit $i$ from
ZIP code $z$ in period $t$.
We say that a ZIP code $i$ is treated ``directly'' at time $t$ if $\mw_{it}>0$.
For this appendix, we think of $\Z$ as the ZIP codes in a closed metropolitan 
area. 
%% SH: To match the stacked model
Following Section \ref{sec:empirical_strategy} we assume the following functional
form for the causal model in first differences:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:causal_model}
    \Delta r_{it} = \gamma \Delta \mw_{it} 
                  + \beta \sum_{z\in\Z} \pi_{iz} \Delta \mw_{zt}
                  + \delta_t + \Delta \varepsilon_{it}
\end{equation}
where $\delta_t$ is a time effect,
$\Delta \varepsilon_{it}$ stands for other factors that determine the evolution
of rents in ZIP code $i$, and
other objects are defined as in the paper.
We show that the parameters $\beta$ and $\gamma$ can be recovered from data on 
rent changes and minimum wage changes under suitable parallel-trends 
assumptions.

\begin{prop}[Identification]\label{prop:did_id}
    Consider a policy such that, 
    for some (directly treated) ZIP codes  $z\in\Z_0\subset\Z$ for non-empty $\Z_0$,
        $\Delta\mw_{zt}=\Delta\mw>0$ if $t=\bar{t}$ and
        $\Delta\mw_{zt}=0$           if $t\neq\bar{t}$,
    and for (not directly treated) ZIP codes $z\notin\Z_0$ ,
        $\Delta\mw_{zt}=0$ for all $t$.
    Assume
    (1) there exist at least two not directly treated ZIP codes with differential 
    exposure to the policy, 
    (2) parallel trends among two non-empty subgroups of not directly treated 
    ZIP codes (specified below),
    (3) parallel trends across directly treated ZIP codes and not directly 
    treated ZIP codes.
    Then, the parameters $\beta$ and $\gamma$ in the structural model 
    \ref{eq:causal_model} are identified.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}
    The expected evolution of rents in ZIP codes not treated directly is
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:expected_rents_nottreated}
        E[\Delta r_{it} | i\notin\Z_0] = 
        \begin{cases}
            \delta_t + E[\Delta \varepsilon_{it} | z\notin\Z_0] 
                                       & \text{ if } t\neq\bar{t} \\
            \beta\sum_{z\in\Z_0}\pi_{iz}\mw_{zt} + \delta_t 
                     + E[\Delta \varepsilon_{it} | z\notin\Z_0] 
                                       & \text{ if } t=\bar{t} ,
        \end{cases}
    \end{equation}
    Now, rank theese ZIP codes according to their exposure to the policy 
    $\Pi_i = \sum_{z\in Z_0} \pi_{iz}$.
    Consider a partition of ZIP codes in $\Z\setminus\Z_0$ in 
    two non-empty subsets such that 
    ZIP codes with $\Pi_i > \bar\Pi$ belong to a ``high exposure'' group $\Z_h$, 
    and the rest to a ``low exposure'' group $\Z_l$,
    where $\bar\Pi\in\left(\min{\Pi_i}, \max{\Pi_i}\right)$.
    Using \ref{eq:expected_rents_nottreated} we can compute, for $t\neq \bar{t}$,
    \begin{equation*}
        E[\Delta r_{it} | i\in\Z_h] - E[\Delta r_{it} | i\in\Z_l] = 
        E[\Delta \varepsilon_{it} | i\in\Z_h] - E[\Delta \varepsilon_{it} | i\in\Z_l] ,
    \end{equation*}
    and for $t = \bar{t}$,
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{split}
            E[\Delta r_{it} | i\in\Z_h] - E[\Delta r_{it} | i\in\Z_l] 
            & = \beta \left(E\left[\sum_{z\in\Z_0}\pi_{iz} \Big| i\in\Z_h\right]
                           - E\left[\sum_{z\in\Z_0}\pi_{iz} \Big| i\in\Z_l\right]\right) \Delta \mw  \\
            & + E[\Delta \varepsilon_{it} | i\in\Z_h] - E[\Delta \varepsilon_{it} | i\in\Z_l] .
        \end{split}
    \end{equation*}
    Under assumption (2), namely that 
    $E[\Delta \varepsilon_{it} | i\in\Z_h] 
     - E[\Delta \varepsilon_{it} | i\in\Z_l] = 0$,
    we can re-arrange the previous equation to obtain
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:id_beta}
        \beta = \frac{E[\Delta r_{it} | i\in\Z_h] - E[\Delta r_{it} | i\in\Z_l]}
                     {\left(E[\sum_{z\in\Z_0}\pi_{iz} | i\in\Z_h] - E[\sum_{z\in\Z_0}\pi_{iz} | i\in\Z_l]\right) \Delta \mw}.
    \end{equation}
    Assumption (1) guarantees that 
    $\left(E[\sum_{z\in\Z_0}\pi_{iz} | i\in\Z_h] 
          - E[\sum_{z\in\Z_0}\pi_{iz} | i\in\Z_l]\right) \neq 0$,  
    thus $\beta$ is identified.

    For those ZIP codes that are treated directly, the expected evolution of 
    rents is
    \begin{equation*}\label{eq:expected_rents_treated}
        E[\Delta r_{it} | i\in\Z_0] = 
        \begin{cases}
            \delta_t + E[\Delta \varepsilon_{it} | z\notin\Z_0] 
                                       & \text{ if } t\neq\bar{t} \\
            \gamma\Delta\mw + \beta\sum_{z\in\Z_0}\pi_{iz}\Delta\mw + \delta_t 
                     + E[\Delta \varepsilon_{it} | z\notin\Z_0] 
                                       & \text{ if } t=\bar{t} .
        \end{cases}
    \end{equation*}
    Differencing with respect to \ref{eq:expected_rents_nottreated} obtains, 
    for $t=\bar{t}$,
    \begin{equation*}
        \begin{split}
            E[\Delta r_{it} | i\in\Z_0] - E[\Delta r_{it} | i\notin\Z_0] 
              & = \gamma \Delta \mw  \\
              & + \beta \left(E\left[\sum_{z\in\Z_0}\pi_{iz} \Big| i\in\Z_0\right]
                           - E\left[\sum_{z\in\Z_0}\pi_{iz} \Big| i\notin\Z_0\right]\right) \Delta \mw  \\
              & + E[\Delta \varepsilon_{it} | i\in\Z_0] - E[\Delta \varepsilon_{it} | i\notin\Z_0] .
        \end{split}
    \end{equation*}
    Assumption (3) means that
    $E[\Delta \varepsilon_{it} | i\in\Z_0] 
      - E[\Delta \varepsilon_{it} | i\notin\Z_0] = 0$.
    Substituting in the previous equation yields
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:id_gamma}
        \gamma = \frac{E[\Delta r_{it} | i\in\Z_0] - E[\Delta r_{it} | i\notin\Z_0]}{\Delta\mw}
            - \beta \left(E\left[\sum_{z\in\Z_0}\pi_{iz} \Big| i\in\Z_0   \right] 
                        - E\left[\sum_{z\in\Z_0}\pi_{iz} \Big| i\notin\Z_0\right]\right) .
    \end{equation}
    Since $\beta$ is known per equation \ref{eq:id_beta}, $\gamma$ is identified
    as well.
\end{proof}
