% an important contribution.

In recent years, many US jurisdictions have introduced minimum wages above the 
federal level of \$7.25, which resulted in minimum wage levels that vary 
substantially within metropolitan areas.
Minimum wage (hereafter MW) policies are \textit{place-based} in that they are 
tied to a location, and workers may work and live in locations under different 
MW levels, crucially impacting the effects of changes in these policies across 
space.
While most research on the effects of the minimum wage has focused on employment 
and wages irrespective of location 
\parencite[e.g.,][]{CardKrueger1994, AutorEtAl2016, CegnizEtAl2019}, 
a full account of the welfare consequences of the MW requires an understanding of 
how it affects different markets and how its effects spill over across different 
neighborhoods.

In this paper, we study the short-run effect of MW policies across local rental 
housing markets.
One approach to answer this question would be to relate the MW of a region with 
some measure of housing rents of people residing in that region.
This approach, which is the one that was taken in the existing literature, appears 
sensible only if all low-wage workers live and worke in the same place.
However, if workers are subject to different wage floors in their workplace and
residence locations, and residence and workplace minimum wages have different 
effects on housing demand, this approach will yield confounded results.
For instance, if the MW increases in the city center, it will likely affect the 
rents of low-wage workers that commute there from other neighborhoods.
Figure \ref{fig:shares_own_geo} shows that the share of workers residing and 
working on the same geographical unit is low, especially at the local level.
As a result, we expect the effects of a local MW increase on rents---and thus on 
welfare of workers and homeowners---to be heterogeneous across space, both in 
places within the jurisdiction that passed the new legislation and in affecting
other neighbordhoods depending on prevailing commuting patterns.

% CHALLENGES. These paragraphs explain why your research question has not already
% been answered, i.e., what are the central challenges a researcher must tackle to
% answer this question.

There is little research attempting to estimate the causal effect of minimum wage 
policies on the housing market and none accounting for spatial spillovers.
To the best of our knowledge, the only papers that estimate the causal effect of 
minimum wages on rents in the same location are \textcite{Tidemann2018} and 
\citeauthor{Yamagishi2019} (\citeyear{Yamagishi2019, Yamagishi2021}).%
\footnote{\textcite{Yamagishi2019} explores this question using data from both the
US and Japan. In the published version of the paper, \textcite{Yamagishi2021} 
excludes the analysis of the US case.}
Estimating empirically the effects of MW policies on rents is challenging. 
First, as opposed to assessing effects on the labor market where jobs and wages 
are tied to the workplace, when evaluating the housing market it is crucial to 
account for the fact that people may reside and work under different MW levels. 
This is challenging because it requires to define an appropriate measure for 
workplace MW, which in turn requires data on commuting patterns at the local level.
Second, estimation at the local level requires spatially dissagregated data on rents.
Using large geographies might result in null or even negative effects on average,
even if no one commutes outside of this region and the actual effect (of workplace
MW) is positive.%
\footnote{Rents in neighborhoods where low-wage workers live are likely to 
increase, whereas elsewhere they are likely not to change or even decrease, as 
those residents ``pay'' for the higher MW through higher prices and lower profits.
The sign of the resulting effect in the larger geography is ambiguous.}
In addition, as MW changes are unlikely to be set considering the dynamics of 
local rental markets, when using small geographic units the exogeneity assumptions 
required for identification appear more plausible.
Third, even if using local variation in MW changes, the effects estimated over 
longer time horizons may conflate changes in migration, housing demand, and 
housing supply.

% THIS PAPER. This paragraph states in a nutshell what the paper accomplishes and how.

We introduce several innovations to tackle these challenges.
First, we theoretically recognize that minimum wage policies will spill over across
housing markets through commuting.
We device a new model-based estimation approach where rents in each local housing 
market are affected by two MW-based measures, one summarizing the effect of 
residence MW and a second one the effect of workplace MW.
Second, we use a novel panel dataset on rents at the USPS ZIP code level and with 
a monthly frequency from Zillow, the largest online rental marketplace in the US.
We couple those data with an original dataset of binding minimum wages at the
ZIP code level, and commuting origin-destination matrices from \textcite{LODES}.
As a result, we are able to estimate the effect of MW policies on rents using 
variation of hundreds of policy changes staggered across small jurisdictions and 
months that generate plausibly exogenous variation of workplace and residence MW
levels.
We exploit the monthly frequency of our data to focus on effects immediately
around the month of MW changes.
Finally, we use our estimated model to evaluate the short-run impact of a federal 
MW increase from \$7.25 to \$9 on rents.
Coupling our estimates with IRS data, we approximate the ZIP code-specific share on 
each dollar of income change that accrues to landlords.

% MODEL. Summarize the key formal assumptions you will maintain in your analysis.

We start by laying out a partial equilibrium model of a ZIP code's rental market,
which is embedded in a larger geography.
We allow residents of this ZIP code to commute to other ZIP codes to work, 
potentially under a different MW policy.
In the model workers demand square feet of housing as a function of local prices 
and income, which in turn depend on the MW levels they face at residence and 
workplace locations, respectively.
This short-run model imposes fixed commuting patterns and fully flexible prices.%
\footnote{This assumption is motivated by our dataset, which varies at the monthly
level. Thus, we expect the first order effects of MW changes to not affect where
agents live and work.
We also believe that this assumption is consistent with the recent MW literature
finding small effects of MW changes on employment over longer time horizons
\parencite[see][for a review]{Dube2019}.
Relatedly, \textcite{PerezPerez2021} finds small elasticities of commuting to MW 
policies in a time horizon of several years.}
Motivated by the evidence of the effect of MW policies on income and prices 
\parencite{AllegrettoReich2018, Leung2021}, we assume that MW hikes in the    %% SH: It would be nice to cite a paper on income
workplace increase disposable income and MW hikes in the residence increase local 
prices.%
\footnote{We also assume that housing is increasing in income and decreasing in 
local consumption prices.}
%%%%% SH: Reconsider assumptions after revising model.
%%%%%     What inequalities should be weak?
The model illustrates that, under these conditions, then the effect of a change 
in MW legislation would be heterogeneous across ZIP codes depending on whether it 
mostly changes the workplace or residence MW of its residents.
In particular, we show that an increase in some workplace MW will cause rents to 
go up, whereas an increase in residence MW will (conditional on workplace MW) lower
rents.
We also show that, under the assumption that workers who work in different 
locations have a similar elasticity of housing demand with respect to income, the 
effect of changes in MW at workplaces on log rents can be summarized in a single 
measure, which we call a ZIP code's \textit{workplace MW}.
We use this result to motivate our empirical model.

% DATA. Explain where you obtain your data and how you measure the concepts that 
% are central to your study.

We construct a panel at the USPS ZIP code and monthly levels with rental prices 
and binding MW policies.
Our main rent variable comes from Zillow, the largest online real estate platform 
in the US \parencite{realestateagentpdx, investopedia}, and corresponds to the 
median rent price per square foot across Zillow listings in the given ZIP code-month 
cell of the category Single Family, Condominiums and Cooperative Houses (SFCC).
This is the most popular housing category in the US \parencite{Fernald2020}, 
and also the most populated series in the Zillow data.
We collect data on MW changes from \textcite{VaghulZipperer2016} for the period 
2010--2016, which we update until January 2020 using data from 
\textcite{BerkeleyLaborCenter} and validating with offical sources.
We assign a binding MW to each ZIP code by taking the maximum across all the
MWs that affect that ZIP code (city, state, and federal levels).%
\footnote{To do this we perform two matching procedures between geographical units.
First, we match USPS ZIP codes to census ZIP code tabulation areas (ZCTA) using 
the crosswalk from \textcite{UDSMapper}.
Second, we match ZCTAs to city and states using crosswalk from 
\textcite{MissouriCenter}.}
%%% SH: Should we detail the procedure we use to keep one ZCTA per ZIP code?
%%%     
We use our MW data coupled with commuting origin-destination matrices obtained from 
the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics Origin-Destination Employment 
Statistics \textcite[LODES;][]{LODES} database to construct the workplace MW for 
each ZIP code, defined as a weighted average of the log statutory MW in each other 
ZIP code where its residents work, where the weights are the share of population 
that work in each one of them.

We also collect data on 
regional economic trends from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages 
\textcite[QCEW;][]{QCEW}; 
wage and business income from at the ZIP code-year levels from \textcite{IRS}; and 
measures of characteristics of a ZIP codes' residents from \textcite{ACS, 
IPUMS_NHGIS}.

% METHODS. Explain how you take your model to the data and how you overcome the 
% challenges you raised in paragraphs 3-4.

Guided by the theoretical model, we pose an empirical model where log rents in 
a location depend on
(1) residence MW---the log of the same location statutory MW---,
(2) workplace MW---the weighted average of log statutory MW in other ZIP codes,
where weights are commuting shares---,
(3)  ZIP code and time period fixed effects,
and 
(4) time-varying controls.
As shocks to rents are expected to be serially correlated over time within ZIP codes, 
we estimate the model in first-differences.
As we discuss in the body of the paper, this model recovers the true causal effect
of the minimum wage assuming that, within a ZIP code, changes in each of our MW 
variables are \textit{strictly exogenous} with respect to changes in the error 
term, conditional on the other MW measure.
To mitigate concerns of changes in the composition of our sample of ZIP codes 
while keeping as many of them as possible, in our baseline analysis we use a 
partially balanced panel.%
\footnote{We use all ZIP codes with valid rents data as of July 2015. 
In February 2010, when our Zillow data starts there are only 9 ZIP codes.}
Using an argument akin to the recent difference-in-differences literature
\parencite[e.g.,][]{CallawaySantAnna2021,CallawayEtAl2021}, 
in an appendix we tease out the comparisons that pin down the coefficients of our 
model, and how they relate to the treatment effects of interest.

% FINDINGS. Describe the key findings. Make sure they connect clearly to the 
% motivation in paragraphs 1-2.

Our preferred specification implies that a 10 percent increase in the workplace
MW only increases rents by 0.65 percent (SE=0.27).
If the residence MW also increases, then rents would increase by 0.34 percent 
instead (SE=0.15).
%% THIS STANDARD ERROR SHOULD BE THE ONE OF THE SUM
The reason is that the residence MW is estimated to have a negative partial effect
on rents.
These results are clear evidence that, holding fixed the commuting shares, MW 
changes spill over spatially through commuting, affecting local housing markets 
in places beyond the boundary of the jurisdiction that instituted the policy.
We find that a naive model estimated only on the same-location MW would yield a 
similar coefficient to the sum of our workplace and residence coefficients.
However, this model would predict changes in rents only at residence locations and 
would not account for MW spillovers, which are central to characterizing the rich
pattern that these policy changes generate and to understanding their 
distributional consequences.

Heterogeneity analyses show that ...

%% ROBUSTNESS

We conduct several robustness checks to test the validity of our results.
First, we test our identifying assumption using leads and lags of each MW variable.
Reassuringly, our models show no effects of future MW changes on current rents.
We also show the robustness of our results by estimating our model with different 
sets of controls that should account for a variety of confounders, such as the state
of the local economy or local heterogeneity in rental dynamics.
Second, in an appendix we show that our results are similar in a ``stacked regression'' 
model that compares ZIP codes within metropolitan areas where some but not all
experienced a change in the statutory MW.
Third, as rental listings may stay on Zillow for more than a month, one may worry 
about structural auto-correlation in the dependent variable which, if not accounted 
for, may bias our estimates.
In an appendix, we present an alternative model that includes the lagged first 
difference of rents as a control and estimate it via instrumental variables
following \textcite{ArellanoBond1991} and \textcite{MeerWest2016}.
%At the cost of imposing a particular auto-correlation structure in the error term, this 
%specification has the advantage of allowing %for feedback effects from current rental 
% price shocks to future minimum wage changes \parencite{ArellanoHonore2001}. 
Both alternative estimation procedures yield results that are very similar to our 
baseline.
Finally, we estimate variations of our model under a fixed composition of ZIP codes;
using an unbalanced panel with full set of ZIP codes and ``cohort-by-time'' fixed 
effects; and re-weightingn the data to match key moments of the distribution of 
US urban ZIP codes.
Our results are robust to these exercises.

%% COUNTERFACTUAL

In the final part of the paper, we develop a simple extension to our baseline model
to estimate the ZIP code-specific share on each dollar that accrues to landlords
following a MW increase.
This parameter depends on the change in the total wage bill of a ZIP code, and the 
share of a ZIP code's total income spent in housing.
We posit a model for the wage bill similar to our baseline, and estimate an 
elasticity of wages to the minimum wage that is in line with the literature
\parencite[e.g.,][]{CegnizEtAl2019}.
Due to data constraints, we assume a range of values for the share of housing
expenditure at the ZIP code level.
%% CAn you cite a paper justifying the assumed share of expenditure?
We focus on studying the consequences of a counterfactual increase in the federal 
MW from \$7.25 to \$9 on January 2020.
We find large variation in the estimated resulting rent changes across ZIP codes.
We estimate that, in ZIP codes where both the residence and workplace MWs increase
due to the policy, landlords pocket between 5 and 8 cents on the dollar.
However, in ZIP codes where the residence MW does not change, the share pocketed
by landlords is higher.

%% LITERATURE

This paper is related to several strands of literature.
First, our paper relates to the large literature estimating the effects of minimum 
wage policies on labor market outcomes.
Starting with \citeauthor{CardKrueger1994}'s (\citeyear{CardKrueger1994}) classical 
study, many papers have explored the effect of these policies on employment
\parencite[some recent examples include][]{MeerWest2016,CegnizEtAl2019}.%
\footnote{See \textcite{Neumark2006} for an earlier review of this literature,
and \textcite{Dube2019, NeumarkShirley2021} for more recent reviews.}
Similarly, several papers study the consequences of minimum wage policies on 
income inequality \parencite{Lee1999, AutorEtAl2016}.
There is also a growing literature studying the effects of local minimum wage 
changes \parencite{DubeLindner2021}.
We contribute to this literature by focusing on a relatively less studied channel
through which minimum wage policies at subnational jurisdictional levels 
may affect welfare: the housing market.

Second, this paper is similarly related to the literature studying the effects 
of MW policies on housing markets.
We already mentioned the scant literature estimating the effects of MW policies
on rental housing prices \parencite{Tidemann2018, Yamagishi2021}.
We innovate in several ways relative to these papers.
First, while these papers estimate the effect of same-location MW on rents, we 
differentiate between residence and workplace MW levels, fully incorporating
spillovers across regions.
Second, we use data at a more detailed geography and higher frequency.%
\footnote{Both \textcite{Tidemann2018} and \textcite{Yamagishi2019} for the US 
exploit Fair Markets Rents data from the US Department of Housing and Urban 
Development (HUD), which is available at the yearly level and aggregated at the
geographical level of counties.}
Both of these facts enrich our understanding of the estimated effects and make 
the required identification assumptions more plausible.
Our paper also relates to \textcite{Hughes2020} who uses a triple difference 
strategy to study the effect of MW policies on rent-to-income ratios. Like us, 
the author explicitly mentions disentangling general equilibrium effects from 
effects on rental markets as a motivation for his approach.
\footnote{Another related paper is \textcite{AgarwalEtAl2019} who show that MW
increases lower the probability of rental default.}
Our work is also related to work studying the effects of MW policies on commuting
and migration \parencite{Cadena2014,Monras2019,PerezPerez2021}, and prices of 
consumption goods \parencite{AllegrettoReich2018,Leung2021}

Third, we also contribute to the literature on place-based policies.
\parencite{KlineMoretti2014} presents a review of place-based policies, and argues
that these policies result in inefficiencies due to finite housing supply 
elasticites in different locations.
Relatedly, \textcite{HsiehMoretti2019} quantify the aggregate cost of housing 
constraints.
In line with this insight, we show in our counterfactual analysis that landlords
may benefit from a MW increase, eroding some of the rise in low-wage workers' 
income generated by the policy. 

Finally, our paper relates to the literature on the econometric issues arising 
from the presence of spillover effects across units,
both in the context of minimum wage policies \parencite{Kuehn2016, Huang2020}, 
and more generally of any policy that spills over spatially
\parencite{DelgadoFlorax2015, Butts2021}.
In our setting we exploit knowledge of commuting patterns to specify the exposure
of each unit to treatment in other units.
Under this functional form assumption we are able to account for spatial spillovers
of MW policies on rents, allowing us to estimate rich effect patterns on the rent 
gradient.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
In Section \ref{sec:model} we introduce a motivating model of the rental market.
In Section \ref{sec:data} we present our data.
In Section \ref{sec:empirical_strategy} we discuss our empirical strategy and
we discuss our identification assumptions.
In Section \ref{sec:results} we present our results.
