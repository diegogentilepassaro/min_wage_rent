In recent years, many U.S. jurisdictions have introduced minimum wages (hereafter MW) 
above the federal level of \$7.25.\footnote{As of January 2020, there were 29 states with 
	a MW larger than the federal one, 52 counties that set a MW above the state, and 15 
	cities with a minimum above the county.}
%%%% SH: How is this computed? Document
Following the early work of \textcite{CardKrueger2000}, most research effort has been 
devoted to understanding the effects of MW policies on 
employment \parencite[e.g.,][]{Neumark2006, DubeEtAl2010, MeerWest2016, CegnizEtAl2019} 
and income inequality \parencite{Lee1999, AutorEtAl2016}.
This is not surprising, as labor market effects are of first order importance to 
determine the welfare implications of MW changes on households. However, the 
\textit{place-based} nature of MW provisions makes it natural to expect that such 
policies will affect the welfare of households through other channels, such as the 
housing market.
Not accounting for the potential effect of MW changes on rents may lead to inaccurate 
welfare analysis.

Given these remarks, we pose the question: by what extent (if any) are local rents 
affected by the minimum wage? 
Surprisingly, there is little research attempting to estimate the causal effect of MW 
policies on the housing market. 
To the best of our knowledge, the only papers aiming at answering this question directly 
are \textcite{Tidemann2018} and \citeauthor{Yamagishi2019} (\citeyear{Yamagishi2019, 
Yamagishi2020}).\footnote{\textcite{Yamagishi2019} explores this question using data from 
	both the U.S. and Japan. In an updated version of the paper, \textcite{Yamagishi2020} 
	excludes the analysis of the U.S. case.}
Even though they both use the same data at the year county level for the U.S, they find 
opposing results. \citeauthor{Tidemann2018}'s (\citeyear{Tidemann2018}) estimates are 
negative, whereas the results of \textcite{Yamagishi2019} point towards a positive 
effect.\footnote{\textcite{Yamagishi2019} attributes this difference to different model 
	specifications, and argues that with proper standard errors clustering the results in 
	\textcite{Tidemann2018} are statistically insignificant.} 
In a related paper, \textcite{AgarwalEtAl2019} shows that minimum wages decrease the 
probability of rental default, suggesting a strengthening of the local labor market. 
Lastly, in a closely related paper, \textcite{Hughes2020} leverages MW changes as a 
natural experiment to study the relationship between housing demand and policies 
affecting low-wage households. 
His approach aims at disentangling the income effect on housing demand from the 
``general equilibrium'' price effect in the long-run, making our work related yet 
distinct as we focus on prices in the short-run. He shows that a 10 percent increase in 
MW decreases the rent-to-income ratio by 1.4 percent.

Provided that MW policies have small disemployment effects, theory suggests that the 
effect on rents will be positive. 
A canonical version of the Alonso-Muth-Mills model, for example, predicts that general 
wage increases will be fully capitalized by landlords.\footnote{See 
	\textcite{Brueckner1987} for a complete treatment of this model.} 
In the same tradition, \textcite{Yamagishi2020} shows that minimum wage policies increase 
rents if disemployment effects are small, and that rents are a sufficient statistic of 
welfare under free mobility. 
Our paper is motivated by the view that rents are determined by supply and demand of 
housing in the local market.
MW provisions will increase incomes and thus housing demand in locations where MW workers 
live and, as a result, rents should be impacted there.

Understanding the effects of MW policies on the housing market is important both from a 
theoretical and policy perspective. As recent literature has shown, individuals 
respond to changes in local prices (and amenities) by migrating, and this fact has 
important implications for welfare and inequality \parencite{Diamond2016, Couture2019}. 
Several papers make a similar point for the case of MW policies, arguing that they 
influence migration decisions and the location of economic activity 
\parencite{PerezPerez2018, Monras2019}.
We believe that a reliable estimate of the effect of MW policies on the local housing 
market will inform this literature and can serve as an important input for policy-makers.
 
In this paper, we construct a dataset at the U.S. ZIP code and monthly date levels to 
explore the reduced form effects of MW changes on rents. Our main rent variable comes 
from Zillow, the largest online real estate platform in the U.S. 
\parencite{realestateagentpdx, investopedia}, and corresponds to the median rent price 
per square foot across Zillow listings in the given ZIP code-month cell of the category 
Single Family, Condominiums and Cooperative Houses (SFCC).
This is the most popular housing category in the U.S. \parencite{fernald2020americas}, 
and also the most populated series in Zillow.
We collect data on minimum wage changes from \textcite{VaghulZipperer2016} for the period 
from 1974 to 2016, which we update until January 2020 using 
\textcite{BerkeleyLaborCenter}. 
We use our MW data coupled with origin-destination matrices obtained from the LEHD 
Origin-Destination Employment Statistics (LODES) database to construct the experienced 
MW,\footnote{LEHD is short for Longitudinal Employer-Household 		
	Dynamics, which corresponds the source of the origin-destination data.}
defined, for each ZIP code, as a weighted average of the statutory MW in each other ZIP 
code where its residents work, using as weights the share of population that work in each 
one of them.
We also collect data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) sources 
to both validate our empirical model and to deploy as controls in our regressions.
Finally, we use data from the U.S. Census and from LODES to explore heterogeneity of the 
effect of interest.

Our main empirical approach uses difference-in-differences panel specifications that 
condition both on monthly date and ZIP code fixed effects.
We begin by estimating a \textit{static} model in which minimum wage changes affect rents 
in the same period.
As has been long established in the literature, this estimate recovers the true causal 
effect assuming that, within a ZIP code, MW changes are \textit{strictly exogenous} with 
respect to changes in the error term (conditional on our controls). We argue that this is 
a plausible assumption.
We subsequently estimate a \textit{dynamic} model by extending our static model with 
leads and lags of MW changes. This allows us to test potential dynamic effects of the MW 
on rents---ruled out buy assumption in the static model---, and to assess the underlying 
parallel trends assumption.
Intuitively, assuming no anticipatory effects in the housing market, differential trends 
across treated and untreated ZIP codes would show up as non-zero pre-trends. 
Reassuringly, our models show no effects of future MW changes on current rents. They do, 
however, suggest a short-lived dynamic effect over the first couple months following a MW 
increase.

We validate our empirical strategy by testing our basic model in several ways. 
First of all, we check for the presence of unobservables affecting both rents and MW 
changes in three ways:
(i) we show that is reasonable to think of supply as fixed around a short window of the 
MW changes;
(ii) we include controls that proxy for the state of the economy and are plausibly not 
affected by the changes in the MW; and (iii) we allow for richer heterogeneity across ZIP 
codes by controlling for ZIP-code-specific linear and quadratic trends.
These specifications should capture a wide range of potential confounders in our main 
regressions.
The fact that our baseline estimates are robust to the inclusion of these controls 
strengthens the case for the strict exogeneity assumption of MW changes.
Second, as rental listings may stay on Zillow for more than one month, one may worry 
about structural auto-correlation in the dependent variable which, if not accounted for, 
may bias our estimates.
For this reason, we estimate alternative models that include the lagged first difference 
of rents as controls, estimated via instrumental variables following 
\textcite{ArellanoBond1991} and related literature.
%At the cost of imposing a particular auto-correlation structure in the error term, this 
%specification has the advantage of allowing %for feedback effects from current rental 
% price shocks to future minimum wage changes \parencite{ArellanoHonore2001}. 
The estimates of this model are strikingly similar to our baseline results, rendering 
credibility to our econometric assumptions.

Finally, a drawback of the Zillow data is that it includes a subsample U.S. ZIP codes. 
This fact brings about two concerns.
First, the composition of ZIP codes changes over time potentially introducing bias in our 
estimates. We tackle this issue by performing our main analysis with a constant set of 
units with valid data as of 2015.\footnote{Because these ZIP codes enter the sample at 
	different moments in time before 2015, our estimating panel is still unbalanced. 
	However, no ZIP code has missing values after it enters the panel.}
This strategy alleviates concerns arising from the changing composition of ZIP codes, but 
significantly lowers the number of observations used in the estimation. For this reason, 
we also estimate a model on the full sample of available ZIP codes, obtaining similar 
results.
Secondly, we worry that our estimated effect may be particular to our subsample. In order 
to approximate the average treatment effect for the typical urban ZIP code, we re-weight 
our data to match average demographic characteristics of the top 100 Metropolitan 
Statistical Areas and re-estimate our main models. The effects not only survive this test 
but are also larger.

The \textit{static} difference-in-differences specification implies that a 10 percent 
increase in the MW leads to an average 0.26 percent increase in the rental price per 
square foot.
When expanding the model to account for \textit{dynamic} effects, we see that a 10 
percent increase in the minimum wage increases rents by 0.58 percent in a 6-months period.
Estimates of the long-run effect using the panel specification that includes the lagged 
first difference of rents as controls returns are very similar, but more precisely 
estimated.

In an effort to disentangle who are the ``winners and losers", we perform an 
heterogeneity analysis of the average treatment effect by allowing the coefficients to 
differ across quartiles of the distribution of ZIP code characteristics.
The results suggest that the effect of interest is indeed heterogeneous.
ZIP codes with lower shares of college graduates (bottom quartiles), as well as 
ZIP codes with higher shares of residents below 24 years old and African-American 
residents (top quartiles) experience a rent increase which is almost twice as large.
We then use LODES data to identify, for each ZIP code, the share of young, low-income 
workers and residents, respectively.
We argue that these characteristics proxy for MW workers fairly well.
Consistently, we show that ZIP codes with low concentration of MW earners as residents 
exhibit no significant effects.
On the other hand, we find that the effect is roughly constant across ZIP codes with 
different share of MW workers who work there.

Since it is reasonable to expect workplace and residence locations to differ, the use of 
statutory changes is probably not an accurate measure of where the income gains of MW 
changes are located.
In an extreme case, it could be that a ZIP code experiencing a MW increase actually has 
no MW earners as residents, but plenty as workers.
In that case, we expect to observe changes in rents in those nearby ZIP codes where the 
MW workers reside.
To accommodate for this, we use a measure of ``experienced minimum wage" that uses the 
average MW level a ZIP code's workers are exposed to in their workplace location.
Our results show a slightly higher impact of MW changes on rents when we replace our main 
explanatory variable: a 10 percent MW increase leads to a simultaneous 0.31 percent 
increase in rents.
Interestingly, when we include both the statutory and experienced MW measures in our 
model the effect of the latter gets even larger, whereas the former slightly decreases 
rents.
We interpret this result as consistent with the view that MW policies redistribute income 
geographically from ZIP codes where MW workers work to those where MW workers reside.
Given these income shocks, the supply and demand of local rentals determine the new 
equilibrium in the housing market.

In the final part of the paper, we gauge the magnitude of our estimates by computing the 
pass-through of the policy, which is defined as the ratio between the elasticity of rents 
to the MW and the elasticity of wages to the MW.
To do that, we perform two exercises.
First, we compute the elasticity of wages to the MW using county-quarter data from the 
QCEW. These estimates imply a pass-through of 19 percent.
Secondly, we use estimates of the elasticity of wages to the MW taken from the literature 
and combine it with our results. We compute in this case a 23 percent pass-through.
Because the rents elasticity is somewhat larger, estimates of the pass-through using the 
experienced MW are slightly larger as well.

Our approach has several differences with respect to previous research on the topic.
Both \textcite{Tidemann2018} and \textcite{Yamagishi2019} for the U.S. exploit Fair 
Markets Rents data from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), which is 
available at the yearly level and aggregated at the geographical level of 
counties.\footnote{\textcite{Yamagishi2019}, updated in \textcite{Yamagishi2020}, also 
	uses data at the year-prefecture level for the 47 Japanese prefectures.}
An important advantage of our approach is that we use the exact timing of the MW change 
at the monthly level.
% When using variation arising from a yearly frequency some units are 
%``partially treated" which will tend to understate the magnitude of the effect. 
Another advantage is that we use data at the ZIP code- instead of the 
county-level.\footnote{As of 2019 there were 3,142 counties and 39,295 meaningful ZIP 
	codes in the U.S. We exclude military and unique business ZIP codes in this count, 
	since they are irrelevant for the housing market.} 
We illustrate the importance of having smaller units of analysis with the following 
example.
For a given county, suppose that (1) all low-skill jobs are in one particular ZIP code; 
and (2) low-skill households prefer to live near their jobs. Further assume that, 
following a MW change, employment effects are near zero.\footnote{This is consistent with 
findings in the literature \parencite[for a comprehensive review see][]{Dube2019}.} 
One should then expect demand for housing in the ZIP code with low-skill jobs to increase 
and demand for housing in the rest of the ZIP codes to go down.
If we focus on the effects of the MW increase on the county we might even find that the 
rents go down, when in fact the rents in the ZIP codes where the low skill jobs are 
located are increasing.
Indeed, \textcite{Tidemann2018} finds that a \$1 increase in the MW decreases the yearly 
average of the monthly rent by 1.5 percentage points.\footnote{As pointed out by 
	\textcite{Tidemann2018}, the sign of this effect implies that the labor demand for 
	low skilled workers is elastic. This is at odds with results of null employment 
	effects in the literature.} 

Using a more detailed geography also aids in the empirical estimation.
First of all, it means that we can exploit MW changes at any jurisdictional level, 
effectively increasing the number of events used for identification.
Secondly, it allows us to use more detailed controls, such as ZIP code fixed effects, 
local employment and wages for sectors likely unaffected by MW changes, and ZIP 
code-specific polynomial trends.
This is important because the dynamics of the rental market plausibly vary across ZIP 
codes within a county following trends at the very local level 
\parencite{AlmagroDominguez2019}.
Importantly, these controls make the required identification assumptions more credible. 
Given that the identifying variation comes from within-ZIP codes, the determinants of 
these MW changes are unlikely to be related to the particular ZIP code and, thus, are 
less likely to be correlated to the unobservable determinants of rent dynamics there.

Beyond the contribution to the very recent literature on the effects of MW changes on 
rents, we contribute to several strands of the literature.
First, we contribute to the literature studying the effects of MW policies on the welfare 
of low-skill households \parencite[][among others]{DinardoEtAl1995, Lee1999, 
CardKrueger2000, Neumark2006, AutorEtAl2016, CegnizEtAl2019}.
Most of this literature has focused on disemployment effects. We contribute to this 
strand of literature by exploring the effects of minimum wage policies on the housing 
market.
To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to compute a local measure of experienced 
MW that takes into account commuting patterns.
Related research focused on the direct impact of MW changes on commuting patterns across 
state and city borders \parencite{Mckinnish2017, PerezPerez2018}.
We, on the other hand, use commuting patterns to keep track in a more precise way of the 
income redistribution generated by MW policies.

We also contribute to the literature that studies the response of local prices to MW 
changes. \textcite{Leung2018} provides evidence of the MW impact on grocery store prices, 
suggesting that MW also affects products demand besides raising labor costs. In his 
analysis, he further shows that the effect is larger in poorer regions. Similarly to our 
study, this points out novel channels of heterogeneity in the pass-through that may have 
non-trivial distributional consequences.

Our work also relates to the literature that studies the location decision of agents 
either based on income \parencite{Roback1982, Kennan2011, DesmetRossihansberg2013, 
PerezPerez2018, Monras2019} or on spatial rents and amenity differentials 
\parencite{Diamond2016, AlmagroDominguez2019, Couture2019}.
We contribute by adapting this framework to the case of MW changes as a means to 
rationalize through residential location sorting part of the observed reduced-form effect 
on rents.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In \autoref{sec:data}, we present our data 
sources and show the characteristics of our estimating panel. In 
\autoref{sec:empirical_strategy}, we explain our empirical strategy and we discuss our 
identification assumptions. In \autoref{sec:results}, we present our main results and in
