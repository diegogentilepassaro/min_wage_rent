% THIS PAPER.

Many US jurisdictions have recently enacted minimum wage policies surpassing the 
federal level of \$7.25, creating considerable variation in minimum wage 
(hereafter MW) levels across and even within metropolitan areas.
These policies are inherently \textit{place-based} in that they are tied to 
a location, and workers may live and work in locations under different 
statutory MW levels, suggesting the presence of spatially heterogeneous policy 
effects.
While most research on the effects of the MW has focused on employment and 
wages irrespective of residence and workplace location
\parencite[e.g.,][]{CardKrueger1994, CegnizEtAl2019},
a full account of the welfare effects of MW policies requires an understanding 
of how they affect different markets and how their effects spill over across 
neighborhoods.
In fact, while the MW appears to lower income inequality through the labor 
market \parencite{Lee1999, AutorEtAl2016},
its overall effect on income for low-wage workers may be smaller if there is 
a significant pass-through from MW changes to prices, including housing
\parencite{Macurdy2015}.

In this paper, we study the effect of MW policies on local rental housing 
markets estimating their effects across neighborhoods within a metropolitan
area.
Consider the introduction of a new MW policy in certain neighborhoods of a
metropolitan area in which low-wage workers are more likely to reside outside 
the jurisdiction that enacted it.
The higher MW will cause an increase in the wage income of those low-wage 
workers that commute to work in the affected neighborhoods, causing a boost in 
housing demand and rental prices in residential areas rather 
than workplace ones.
This effect, arising from the MW at the workplace, could undermine the 
distributional objective of the policy.
Additionally, the MW hike may affect the jurisdiction that enacted the policy, 
for instance by increasing prices of non-tradable consumption.
This effect, operating through the MW at the residence, will affect the 
demand for housing as well, and consequently rental prices.
Thus, commuting patterns become an essential ingredient to understand the 
heterogeneous effects of local MW policies.

To operationalize this insight we collect granular data on commuting patterns 
and construct, for each USPS ZIP code (hereafter ZIP code) and month,
the \textit{workplace MW}, defined as the log statutory MW where
the average worker of the ZIP code works.
We also define the \textit{residence MW}, which is just the log statutory MW in 
the same ZIP code.
Figure \ref{fig:map_mw_chicago_jul2019} visually represents these MW-based 
measures by illustrating their changes for the Chicago-Naperville-Elgin 
Core-Based Statistical Area (hereafter CBSA) in July 2019,
when the city of Chicago and Cook County increased the MW from \$12 to \$13 and 
from \$11 to \$12, respectively.
Even though the statutory MW only changed in some locations in the CBSA, the 
increase affected the workplace MW of most locations.
We formulate a simple partial-equilibrium model that suggests that these 
measures are sufficient to determine the change in rents in a 
local housing market.

Studying the within-city spillover effects of the MW requires granular data on 
rents, which is why we employ a novel ZIP code-level panel dataset from Zillow.
Our main rent variable is calculated as the median rental price per square foot 
for listings within a specific ZIP code-month for Single Family houses, 
Condominiums, and Cooperative units (SFCC).%
\footnote{Single family houses are standalone housing units, while condominiums 
    and cooperatives are multi-unit buildings with varying ownership structures 
    \parencite{ZillowTypesOfHomes}.}
This variable captures the posted price of newly available units, 
thereby avoiding tenure biases and more accurately reflecting current market 
conditions \parencite{AmbroseEtAl2015}.
We find that low-wage households are more likely to be renters,
tend to reside in these housing types,
and that rents per square foot are surprisingly uniform across the income 
distribution.
These findings suggest that the Zillow data can feasibly capture any MW effects.
Moreover, the data varies monthly, aligning with the frequency of MW 
changes, thus allowing us to construct an estimation strategy that exploits the 
exact timing of hundreds of policy changes staggered across jurisdictions and 
months.

To estimate the spillover effects of MW policies on rents, we develop a novel 
difference-in-differences strategy that exploits our granular and high-frequency 
data to compare the evolution of rents across ZIP codes differentially exposed 
to workplace MW changes, conditional on the residence MW.
To further illustrate the importance of commuting patterns in the propagation 
of MW shocks, we use our simple model and our main estimated elasticities to 
evaluate two MW policies: 
a federal MW increase and
a local MW increase in the city of Chicago.
We estimate the share of each dollar of extra income (generated by the MW) that 
accrues to landlords both combining all affected areas and in each particular 
location.
We then discuss our results' implications for assessing the distributional 
impact of MW policies.

% MODEL. Summarize the key formal assumptions you will maintain in your analysis.

We start by introducing a motivating partial equilibrium model of a ZIP code's 
rental market, which is part of a larger geography.
The model is populated by workers who demand housing, and the interaction with 
a supply of rental units by absentee landlords determines the equilibrium 
rental price.
Importantly, residents of the ZIP code can commute to work in other ZIP 
codes, possibly under a different MW policy.
Workers' demand for square footage of homogeneous housing space is modelled as 
a function of prices of non-tradable consumption and income, both of which are 
influenced by the MW levels at residence and workplace locations.
The model illustrates that the impact of a change in MW legislation would vary 
across ZIP codes, depending on whether it alters the MW at the workplace,
the residence, or both.
The model implies the impact of MW changes in certain ZIP codes on rents can 
be summarized by the workplace MW and the residence MW measures,
emphasizing the need to control for the residence MW in the empirical analysis.

% METHODS. Explain how you take your model to the data and how you overcome the 
% challenges you raised in paragraphs 3-4.

Guided by the theoretical model, we pose an empirical model where log rents in 
a location depend linearly on
leads and lags of the workplace MW,
the residence MW,
ZIP code and time period fixed effects, and 
time-varying controls.
This compares ZIP codes that are differentially exposed to the workplace MW 
but equally affected by the residence MW, conditional on other factors that 
affect the evolution of rents.
The identification assumption is that, within a ZIP code, 
changes in the workplace MW are strictly exogenous with respect to 
unobserved changes in rents after partialing out the confounding variation 
generated by the residence MW.
Given that MW policies are typically not enacted considering their spillover
effects on local rental markets, we argue that this assumption is plausible.
%Pre-trends testing, as well as robustness tests that use different exposure 
%shares to the MW and alternative specifications, support this assumption.
In an appendix, we discuss a general potential outcomes framework following
\textcite{CallawayEtAl2021}.
%\footnote{Given that our dependent variable has a shift-share structure, our 
%    identification assumptions can also be cast in terms of 
%    \textcite{GoldsmithpinkhamEtAl2020}, where the shares determine the exposure
%    to common minimum wage shocks.}
We demonstrate that, under the assumptions of \textit{parallel trends} and 
\textit{no selection on gains}, 
the effects of the workplace MW and residence MW are identified from the 
conditional slope of log rents with respect to each MW measure.
%The fact that the conditional relationship of log rents with respect to each MW
%measure is nearly linear suggests that no selection on gains is a plausible
%assumption as well.

% FINDINGS. Describe the key findings. Make sure they connect clearly to the 
% motivation in paragraphs 1-2.

Our preferred specification implies that 
a 10 percent rise in the workplace MW (holding constant the residence MW) 
increases rents by $\BothBetaBaseTen$ percent (SE=$\BothBetaBaseTenSE$).
Failing to control for the residence MW results in an estimated effect of 
$\OnlyWkpBetaBaseTen$ (SE=$\OnlyWkpBetaBaseTenSE$), and a model that uses 
the residence MW only results in an even lower estimate of 
$\OnlyResGammaBaseTen$ (SE=$\OnlyResGammaBaseTenSE$).
The reasons these estimates are lower are two-fold.
First, by accounting for the difference between workplace and residence 
locations, the workplace MW is a better measurement of the change in the MW 
that is relevant for a ZIP code's wage income, thus reducing measurement 
error.
Second, controlling for the residence MW removes confounding variation in
rents that is generated by unobserved factors that may respond to it, 
such as prices of non-tradable consumption.
Using a rough approximation to the share of MW workers in each ZIP code, we show 
that the elasticity of rents to the workplace MW is larger in locations 
with more MW residents, consistent with the fact that the effect operates by
changing the income of low-wage workers.
Likewise, we find a lower elasticity in locations with larger average incomes.
%We do not find evidence that the elasticities are different in ZIP codes with
%more public housing.
These results imply that MW changes spill over spatially through commuting, 
affecting local housing markets in places beyond the boundary of the 
jurisdiction that originally enacted the policy.

When including both the workplace and residence MW in our model, we find that 
the coefficient on the residence MW is negative, consistent with the notion 
that increases in local non-tradable consumption ameliorate the effect of the
MW on rents, as in the theoretical model.
However, the coefficient is not statistically significant in our baseline
estimates, and the lack of data on prices of non-tradable consumption of a 
ZIP code's residents prevents us from drawing strong conclusions about 
this effect.

%% ROBUSTNESS

We provide support for our identification assumptions with a battery of 
additional analysis.
First, we test for pre-period coefficients and construct a non-parametric 
analysis of the relationship between log rents and the MW measures.
We find that future MW changes do not predict rents, and the conditional
relationship of log rents with respect to each MW measure is nearly linear,
suggesting that the identification assumptions are plausible.
Second, we estimate our model using a rental index constructed by Zillow that 
controls for variation in the available housing stock at each time.
This variable alleviates concerns that changes in the composition of available 
units, coinciding with MW changes, drive our estimates.
Third, our estimates are robust to using commuting shares for different
years, and they are stronger when we use shares based on jobs below a 
certain nominal income threshold or on younger workers, both of which are 
more likely to be affected by the MW.
This is consistent with the view that identification arises from the ``shares,''
as in \textcite{GoldsmithpinkhamEtAl2020}.
Finally, we construct a ``stacked'' regression model, similar to 
\textcite{CegnizEtAl2019}, that explicitly compares ZIP codes within 
metropolitan areas where some but not all experienced a change in the 
statutory MW.
This helps alleviate concerns that our estimates stem from undesired 
comparisons in difference-in-differences models with staggered treatment 
timing, as highlighted by recent literature 
\parencite{deChaisemartinEtAl2022,RothEtAl2022}.%
\footnote{We also estimate a model that includes the lagged first difference 
	of rents as a control, and is estimated via instrumental variables following 
    \textcite{ArellanoBond1991}.}

Our results remain robust across different sets of controls,
alternative samples of ZIP codes, and reweighing observations to match 
demographics of the population of urban ZIP codes.
We find similar (but noisier) results when we use median rents in 
different housing categories, which are available for smaller samples of 
ZIP codes.

%% COUNTERFACTUAL

In the final part of the paper, we use our motivating model and simulate 
counterfactual exercises to capture the incidence of MW policies on landlords.
We compute the share pocketed by landlords in each ZIP code, and also
compute the total incidence summing across locations.
We simulate two counterfactual MW policies in January 2020, keeping all other
MW policies in their 2019 levels.
In the first scenario, we change the federal MW from \$7.25 to \$9.
In the second, we propose a rise in the Chicago City MW from \$13 to \$14.
We estimate that landlords capture $\totIncidenceCentsFedNine$ cents of each 
dollar across locations in affected CBSAs in the former, and 
$\totIncidenceCentsChiFourteen$ cents of each dollar across locations in the 
Chicago-Naperville-Elgin CBSA in the latter.
We find systematic spatial variation in incidence,
with the share pocketed usually being larger in locations that experience an
increase in the workplace MW but not in the residence MW.
These exercises illustrate that commuting patterns are essential to 
understanding the spatial incidence of MW policies within metropolitan areas.

%% LIMITATIONS

Our analysis has some important limitations.
First, while our workplace MW measure is consistent with a large
body of work relying on variation generated by shift-share instruments 
\parencite[e.g., see recent work by][]{GoldsmithpinkhamEtAl2020,
BorusyakHullJaravel2021}, our formal justification in the theoretical model 
relies on strong constant-elasticity assumptions.
We discuss their plausibility in the body of the paper.
Second, while our model is useful to motivate our empirical strategy, it does 
not account for general equilibrium effects such as changes in commuting 
patterns.
We discuss the potential consequences of relaxing this assumption for our 
empirical results in the context of our model.
Additionally, we caution that our counterfactual simulations based on the model 
should be taken as an approximation to the effects of a small change in the MW.
Third, our exercises do not capture the full welfare effect of MW policies
in the US.
Such an effort would require a general equilibrium model that accounts for 
responses to the MW across several margins.
However, as low-wage households are more likely to rent and thus will be more 
affected by rent effects, our analysis suggest that such a model should 
consider the homeownership status of households.

%% LITERATURE

Our findings contribute to the literature studying the effects of MW policies 
on the housing market.
To our knowledge, the only papers whose goal is to estimate the effect of the 
MW on rents in the same location are \textcite{Tidemann2018} and 
\citeauthor{Yamagishi2019} (\cite*{Yamagishi2019}, \cite*{Yamagishi2021}).%
\footnote{In the working paper version \parencite{Yamagishi2019}, the author 
	explores this question using data from both the US and Japan.
	In the published version \parencite{Yamagishi2021}, he excludes the analysis 
	of the US case.}
\textcite{AgarwalEtAl2022} show that MW increases lower the probability of 
rental default, and also present estimates of the effect of the MW on rents using 
transactions data between 2000 and 2009.
Our paper also relates to \textcite{Hughes2020}, who studies the effect of 
MW policies on rent-to-income ratios.
The key difference of our paper with this work is that we differentiate 
between residence and workplace MW levels, incorporating spillovers across 
regions.
We highlight that this distinction is essential in a context of within-city
variation in MW policies, such as the recent experience in the US.
A second difference is the research design: we use high-frequency,
high-resolution data that allows clean identification at the level of the 
local housing market.

We also contribute to the understanding of place-based policies and the spatial 
transmission of shocks.
\textcite{KlineMoretti2014} argue that place-based policies may result in 
welfare losses due to finite housing supply elasticites.
%\textcite{HsiehMoretti2019} quantify the costs of housing constraints in the US.
In line with this insight, we show that landlords benefit from a 
place-based MW policy depending on their location.
\textcite{AllenEtAl2020} estimate the within-city transmission of expenditure 
shocks in Barcelona.
We, on the other hand, study the within-city transmission of MW shocks.

More broadly, our paper relates to the large literature estimating the effects
of MW policies on employment
(see \cite{Dube2019} and \cite{NeumarkShirley2021} for recent reviews of the 
literature), 
the distribution of income \parencite[e.g.,][]{Lee1999, AutorEtAl2016, 
	Dube2019Income}, 
and the overall welfare effect of the MW \parencite{AhlfeldtEtAl2022,
	BergerHerkenhoffMongey2022}.%
\footnote{Our paper is also related to work studying 
	the effects of local MW policies 
	\parencite[e.g.,][]{DubeLindner2021, JardimEtAl2022seattle}, 
	the effect of MW policies on commuting and migration 
	\parencite[e.g.,][]{Cadena2014, Monras2019, PerezPerez2021}, 
	and prices of consumption goods 
	\parencite[e.g.,][]{Aaronson2001, AllegrettoReich2018, Leung2021}.} %, CooperEtAl2020
Our contributions are to incorporate spillovers across locations 
\parencite[as in the recent work by][]{JardimEtAl2022discontinuity} and to show 
that rent increases erode some income gains of low-wage workers.
We also contribute by developing a novel panel dataset of MW levels at the 
ZIP code level for the entire US.

Finally, our paper relates to work in econometrics that focuses on spillover 
effects across units,
both in the context of MW policies 
\parencite{Kuehn2016, JardimEtAl2022discontinuity}, 
and more generally of any policy that spills over spatially
\parencite{DelgadoFlorax2015, Butts2021}.
Our approach is similar to \textcite{GiroudMueller2019}: we specify a model for 
spillovers across units that allows us to estimate rich effect patterns of the 
MW on rents.
