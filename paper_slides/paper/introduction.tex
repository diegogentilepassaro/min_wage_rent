In recent years, many US jurisdictions have introduced minimum wages above the 
federal level of \$7.25, resulting in minimum wage levels that vary 
substantially across space and even within metropolitan areas.
Minimum wage policies (hereafter MW) are \textit{place-based} in that they are 
tied to a location, and workers may live and work in locations under different 
statutory MW levels, suggesting potentially heterogeneous effects of these 
policies over space.
While most research on the effects of the MW has focused on employment and 
wages irrespective of residence and workplace location
\parencite[e.g.,][]{CardKrueger1994, CegnizEtAl2019},
a full account of the welfare effects of the MW requires an understanding of 
how it affects different markets and how its effects spill over across 
neighborhoods.
In fact, while the MW appears to lower income inequality through the labor 
market \parencite{Lee1999, AutorEtAl2016},
its overall effect on income for low-wage workers may be smaller if there is 
a significant pass-through from MW changes to prices, including housing
\parencite{Macurdy2015}.

In this paper, we study the effect of MW policies on local rental housing 
markets from 2015 to 2019.
Consider a new MW policy in some locations within a metropolitan area.
Because low-wage workers tend to reside in specific neighborhoods with access 
to the (now better-paying) low-wage jobs,
one would expect an increase in disposable income and a subsequent rise in demand 
for housing and rental prices in their residence instead of their workplace.
This effect, which operates through the MW at the workplace, 
will undermine the distributional objective of the policy.
Similarly, the MW hike will translate into higher prices of non-tradable 
consumption that use low-wage workers intensively as an input inside the 
jurisdiction that passed the new policy.
As a result, the demand for housing and rental prices will also be affected.
This effect, which operates through the MW at the residence, will have 
distributional consequences as well.
Commuting patterns thus become an essential ingredient to understand the 
heterogeneous effects of local MW policies.
We operationalize this insight constructing, for each USPS ZIP code (hereafter 
ZIP code) and month,
a ``workplace MW'' measure, which is defined as the log statutory MW where
the average worker of the ZIP code works.
We also define the ``residence MW,'' which is just the log statutory MW in the
same ZIP code.
Figure \ref{fig:map_mw_chicago_jul2019} shows the change in the two MW-based 
measures for the Chicago-Naperville-Elgin Core-Based Statistical Area (CBSA) in 
July 2019, when Cook County increased its MW level from \$12 to \$13.
We observe that, even though the statutory MW only changed in some locations in
the metropolitan area, the increase affected the workplace MW of most locations.

% CHALLENGES. These paragraphs explain why your research question has not already
% been answered, i.e., what are the central challenges a researcher must tackle to
% answer this question.

Estimating the effects of MW policies on rents is challenging for several 
reasons.
First, as opposed to assessing effects on pure labor market outcomes where jobs 
and wages are tied to the workplace, when evaluating the housing market it is 
crucial to account for the fact that people may reside and work under different 
MW levels.%
\footnote{However, several papers have highlighted the importance that studies
on the effect of the MW on employment account for potential spillovers that may
``contaminate'' the control group \parencite{Kuehn2016, Huang2020}.}
%%
%% DGP: I am not sure I understand what you want to say in this footnote.
%% SH: Challenge is that there are spillovers in the housing market, which 
%%     are not as relevant in the labor market
%%     However, a few papers on the labor market say that spillovers do matter 
%%     there
%%
This is challenging because accounting for changes in the MW where residents
of a location work requires data on commuting patterns at the local level.
Second, successful identification of MW effects at the local level requires 
spatially disaggregated, high-frequency data on rents.
Using large geographies might result in null or even negative effects on average,
even if no one commutes outside this region and the actual effect (of 
workplace MW) on some local housing markets is positive.%
\footnote{Rents in neighborhoods where low-wage workers live are likely to 
increase, whereas elsewhere they are likely not to change or decrease, 
as those residents ``pay'' for the higher MW through higher prices and lower 
profits.}
Even if the effects in such geographies may be of interest, they may mask 
substantial heterogeneity and therefore miss the fact that some people may be 
paying higher rents due to the policy change.
Similarly, MW policies change at the monthly level, so using variation at a lower
frequency (such as yearly) will not allow a clean identification using the exact 
month of the MW change.
Finally, the effects of the MW on rents may operate through different channels,
such as prices of consumption, income, or changes in migration and commuting.
Studying the contribution of each channel separately is important to evaluate
the incidence of the policy over different locations and time horizons.

% THIS PAPER. This paragraph states in a nutshell what the paper accomplishes and how.

We introduce several innovations to tackle these challenges.
First, we develop a tractable model that allows the MW to spill over 
across local housing markets through commuting.
According to the model, rents in each local housing market are affected by 
two MW-based measures:
the residence MW and the workplace MW.
The model maps these measures to the effect of the MW via 
(i) consumption prices in the same location and
(ii) income generated across locations.
Second, we use a novel panel dataset on rents at the ZIP code level and with 
a monthly frequency from Zillow, the largest online rental marketplace in the US.
We couple those data with an original panel dataset of statutory MWs 
at the ZIP code level, and commuting origin-destination matrices constructed
from administrative records.
As a result, we are able to estimate the effect of MW policies on rents using 
hundreds of policy changes staggered across jurisdictions and months that 
generate plausibly exogenous variation of workplace and residence MW levels.
% We show that our results are robust to using commuting data from different years
% and for different groups of workers, suggesting that commuting patterns are 
% stable, at least in the time window around events we consider, and thus unlikely
% to affect the results.
%% 
%% SH: Commented out the above for brevity
%% 
We use our estimated model to evaluate the impact of a federal MW increase 
from \$7.25 to \$9 on rents.
Coupling our estimates with ZIP code-level income data, we estimate the share of 
each dollar of extra income (caused by the MW) that accrues to landlords in each 
ZIP code.
We discuss the implications of our results for assessing the distributional 
impact of MW policies.

% MODEL. Summarize the key formal assumptions you will maintain in your analysis.

We start by laying out a partial equilibrium model of a ZIP code's rental market,
which is embedded in a larger geography.
The model allows residents of this ZIP code to commute to other ZIP codes to 
work, potentially under a different MW policy.
In the model workers demand square feet of housing as a function of local prices 
and income which, in turn, depend on the MW levels workers face at residence and 
workplace locations, respectively.
The model imposes fixed commuting patterns alongside fully flexible prices.%
\footnote{In the model we also assume fixed housing quality.}
This assumption, which is motivated by our empirical setting, is also consistent 
with the literature.%
\footnote{Our data varies at the monthly level. 
Thus, we are assuming that the first order effects of MW changes do not affect 
where agents live and work in a window of a few months around MW changes.
Relatedly, \parencite{PerezPerez2021} finds small effects of the MW on commuting
in a time horizon of several years.}
However, we note that validity of our results in the long-run will depend on the
degree of migration as a result of the policy.
The model illustrates that, if housing is a normal good and is complementary 
with non-tradable consumption, the effect of a change in MW legislation 
would be heterogeneous across ZIP codes depending on whether it mostly changes 
the MW of its residents at their residence or at their workplace locations.%
\footnote{In particular, MW increases in workplace locations will cause rents to go up,
whereas increases at residence will (conditional on a constant workplace MW)
will lower rents.}
We show that, assuming that the elasticities of per-capita housing demand 
to income and of income to MW levels do not vary by workplace, the effect of 
changes in MW at workplaces on log rents can be summarized in a single measure:
a ZIP code's workplace MW.
This measure is defined as the weighted average of log minimum wage levels 
across a ZIP code's workplaces, using commuting shares as weights.%
\footnote{We discuss the plausibility of the required constant-elasticity 
assumptions in the body of the paper.}
The effect of changes in the MW at the residence can be summarized by
a single measure as well, the log of the statutory MW in the location.
We use this result to motivate our empirical model.

% DATA. Explain where you obtain your data and how you measure the concepts that 
% are central to your study.

We construct a panel at the ZIP code and monthly levels with rental prices, 
statutory MW levels, and our MW-based measures from January 2015 to December 2019.
The main rent variable comes from Zillow, and corresponds to the median 
rental price per square foot across Zillow listings in the given ZIP 
code-month cell of the category Single Family Houses and Condominiums and 
Cooperative units (SFCC).
The MW data is collected from \textcite{VaghulZipperer2016} and 
\textcite{BerkeleyLaborCenter}.
We use our MW data coupled with commuting origin-destination matrices obtained 
from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics Origin-Destination Employment 
Statistics \parencite[LODES;][]{CensusLODES} database.
These data provide workplace locations for the residents of all the US census 
blocks, and we use it---along with a novel correspondence table between blocks 
and USPS ZIP codes---to construct our workplace MW measure.

% METHODS. Explain how you take your model to the data and how you overcome the 
% challenges you raised in paragraphs 3-4.

Guided by the theoretical model, we pose an empirical model where log rents in 
a location depend on
the residence MW, % defined as the log of the statutory MW at that location
the workplace MW, % defined as the weighted average of log statutory MW in other ZIP codes where weights are commuting shares
ZIP code and time period fixed effects, and 
time-varying controls.
This model recovers the true causal effect of the MW assuming that, 
within a ZIP code, changes in each of our MW variables are 
\textit{strictly exogenous} with respect to changes in the error 
term, conditional on the other MW measure and the controls.
To mitigate concerns of changes in the composition of our sample of ZIP codes, 
in our baseline analysis we use a balanced panel.%
\footnote{We use all ZIP codes with valid rents data as of January 2015.}
Using an argument akin to the recent difference-in-differences literature
\parencite[e.g.,][]{CallawayEtAl2021}, 
in an appendix we unpack our identification beyond the residence and
workplace MW measures.
We state clearly the conditions required on the commuting shares and the 
unobservable determinants of rents under a MW policy that increases the MW in 
a subset of ZIP codes only.

% FINDINGS. Describe the key findings. Make sure they connect clearly to the 
% motivation in paragraphs 1-2.

Our preferred specification implies that 
a 10 percent increase in the workplace MW (holding constant the residence MW) 
\textit{increases} rents by $\BothBetaBaseTen$ percent 
(SE=$\BothBetaBaseTenSE$).
A 10 percent increase in the residence MW (holding constant the workplace MW) 
\textit{decreases} rents by $\BothGammaBaseTenAbs$ percent 
(SE=$\BothGammaBaseTenSE$). 
As a result, if both measures increase simultaneously by 10 percent then 
rents would increase by $\BothSumBaseTen$ percent 
(SE=$\BothSumBaseTenSE$).
These results imply that, holding fixed the commuting shares, MW 
changes spill over spatially through commuting, affecting local housing markets 
in places beyond the boundary of the jurisdiction that instituted the policy.
We find that a naive model estimated only on the same-location MW would yield a 
coefficient similar to the sum of the coefficients on our workplace and 
residence MW measures.
However, this model would not account for MW spillovers to other locations, 
which are central to understanding the distributional consequences of the rich 
pattern of changes in rents generated by this policy.
We explore heterogeneity of our results based on ZIP code characteristics and
find suggestive evidence that results are stronger where low-wage workers are 
located.

%% ROBUSTNESS

We conduct several robustness checks to assess the validity of our results.
First, we evaluate our identification assumption estimating an extended model 
that includes leads and lags of the MW measures, finding no effects of future 
MW changes on current rent changes.
Furthermore, the statistical significance of our main results increases.
Second, we show that when using panels at the county by month and ZIP code by 
year levels one fails to detect effects, highlighting the importance of the 
granularity of our ZIP code by month data.
Third, we show robustness of our results to different sets of controls,
alternative definitions of commuting shares, alternative sample definitions,
and reweighing observations to match demographics of the population of
urban ZIP codes.
Fourth, we estimate our models for different categories of housing rentals and
find overall consistent results.
Finally, in the appendix we estimate two alternative models.
We construct a ``stacked'' regression model, similar to \textcite{CegnizEtAl2019},
that compares ZIP codes within metropolitan areas where some but not all 
experienced a change in the statutory MW.
This should alleviate concerns that our estimates stem from undesired 
comparisons, as highlighted by recent literature 
\parencite{deChaisemartinEtAl2022,RothEtAl2022}.
The second alternative model includes the lagged first difference of rents as 
a control, and is estimated via instrumental variables following 
\textcite{ArellanoBond1991}.
We find similar results in these cases.

%% COUNTERFACTUAL

In the final part of the paper, we construct a counterfactual exercise to 
capture the incidence of a MW policy on landlords.
We compute a ZIP code-specific ``share pocketed by landlords,'' and also
compute the total incidence across locations.
These parameters depend on the changes in wages and rents, and also on the 
share of a ZIP code's total income spent in housing.
We posit a model for total wages similar to our baseline, and estimate an 
elasticity of wages to the minimum wage that is in line with the literature.
We approximate the share of housing expenditure in each ZIP code.
Our main exercise posits a counterfactual increase in the federal MW 
from \$7.25 to \$9 in January 2020.%
\footnote{In an appendix we develop counterfactuals for larger and smaller 
increases in the federal MW.}
We find systematic spatial variation in incidence.
Focusing on metropolitan areas affected by the policy, our estimate of the 
median share pocketed by landlords is $\rhoMedianFedNine$ 
(around $\rhoMedianCentsFedNine$ cents).
In ZIP codes where both the residence and workplace MW increase due to 
the policy, landlords pocket on average $\rhoMeanCentsDirFedNine$ cents of each 
dollar.
In ZIP codes where the residence MW does not change, landlords pocket on average
$\rhoMeanCentsIndirFedNine$ cents of each the dollar.
Overall, we estimate that landlords capture $\totIncidenceCentsFedNine$ cents
of each dollar, reflecting the fact that rent increases tend to be larger in 
locations where landlords pocket a smaller share.

Our results imply that a share of the extra income that low-wage workers
receive due to the policy is actually captured by landlords.
Viewed through the lens of our theoretical model,
the mechanism behind this is a rise in housing demand in a scenario of a 
finite housing supply elasticity.
In the context of a general equilibrium model, \textcite{KlineMoretti2014} argue
that this mechanism causes place-based policies to be welfare inefficient.
While studying the full welfare effects of MW policies is beyond the scope of 
the paper, our results imply that ignoring rent changes will lead to an 
overstatement of the gains of low-wage workers following a MW increase.

%% LITERATURE

This paper is related to several strands of literature.
First, our paper relates to the large literature estimating the effects of 
minimum wage policies on employment
\parencite[e.g.,][]{CardKrueger1994, NeumarkWascher2007, MeerWest2016, CegnizEtAl2019},%
\footnote{See \textcite{Dube2019, NeumarkShirley2021} for recent reviews of the 
literature.} 
and the distribution of income 
\parencite[e.g.,][]{Lee1999, AutorEtAl2016, Dube2019Income}, also in 
the context of local MW policies 
\parencite[e.g.,][]{DubeNaiduReich2007, SchmittRosnick2011, DubeLindner2021}.
Our contribution is to focus on a less studied channel: the housing market.
We point out that this channel may erode some of the income gains of low-wage 
workers.
We also contribute by developing a novel panel dataset of MW levels at the 
ZIP code level for the entire US.

Second, this paper is related to the literature studying the effects of MW 
policies beyond the labor market.
To the best of our knowledge, the only papers that estimate the causal effect 
of MWs on rents in the same location are \textcite{Tidemann2018}, 
\citeauthor{Yamagishi2019} (\cite*{Yamagishi2019}, \cite*{Yamagishi2021}),%
\footnote{In the working paper version \parencite{Yamagishi2019}, the author 
explores this question using data from both the US and Japan.
In the published version \parencite{Yamagishi2021}, he excludes the analysis of 
the US case.}
and \textcite{AgarwalEtAl2021}.%
\footnote{While the main goal of \textcite{AgarwalEtAl2021} is to study the 
effect of the MW on eviction risk, the authors also presents estimates of the
MW on rents using individual-level transactions.}
We innovate in several ways relative to these papers.
First, while these papers estimate the effect of same-location MW on rents, we 
differentiate between residence and workplace MW levels, incorporating
spillovers across regions.
Second, we use data at a more detailed geography and a higher frequency, which
enriches our understanding of the spatial effects on rents and makes the 
required identification assumptions more plausible.
\textcite{AgarwalEtAl2021} show that MW increases lower the probability of 
rental default, and present complementary estimates of the effect of the MW 
on rents.
Our paper also relates to \textcite{Hughes2020}, who studies the effect of 
MW policies on rent-to-income ratios.%
%Like us, the author explicitly mentions disentangling general equilibrium 
%effects from effects on rental markets as a motivation for his approach.%
\footnote{Our paper is also related to work studying the effects of MW policies 
on commuting and migration \parencite{Cadena2014, Monras2019, PerezPerez2021}, and 
prices of consumption goods \parencite{AllegrettoReich2018, Leung2021}.}

Third, we also contribute to the literature on place-based policies and 
on the spatial transmission of shocks.
\textcite{KlineMoretti2014} argue that place-based policies may result in 
welfare losses due to finite housing supply elasticites.%
\footnote{Relatedly, \textcite{HsiehMoretti2019} quantify the aggregate cost 
of housing constraints.}
In line with this insight, we show in our counterfactual analysis that landlords
may benefit from a MW increase.
Our paper also relates to \textcite{AllenEtAl2020}, who estimate the 
within-city transmission of expenditure shocks using tourism in Barcelona.
We, on the other hand, study the within-city transmission of minimum wage shocks.

Finally, our paper relates to the literature on the econometric issues arising 
from the presence of spillover effects across units,
both in the context of MW policies \parencite{Kuehn2016, Huang2020}, 
and more generally of any policy that spills over spatially
\parencite{DelgadoFlorax2015, Butts2021}.
We specify a model for treatment spillovers across units through commuting, 
which allows us to estimate rich effect patterns of the MW on rents.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
In Section \ref{sec:model} we introduce a motivating model of the rental market.
In Section \ref{sec:data} we present our data.
In Section \ref{sec:empirical_strategy} we discuss our empirical strategy and
we discuss our identification assumptions.
In Section \ref{sec:results} we present our results.
Section \ref{sec:counterfactual} discusses a counterfactual minimum wage policy, and
Section \ref{sec:conclusion} concludes.
