    \noindent
    Recently, several sub-national jurisdictions in the US have instituted 
    minimum wage (MW) policies, resulting in significant dispersion of MW levels 
    within metropolitan areas.
    In this paper, we study the effect of MW changes on local housing rental 
    markets exploiting the placed-based nature of MW policies.
    % We argue that commuting patterns are key to understanding the effect of these
    % policies across locations.
    %
    % SH: For brevity I commented out the previous sentence
    % 
    For each location we define both
    the log MW where the average resident works (the ``workplace MW'')
    and the log MW in the location itself (the ``residence MW'').
    We derive a partial-equilibrium model of a housing market
    in which MW levels in each location affect housing demand by 
    changing the income of commuters and the prices of non-tradable consumption. 
    The model shows that the workplace MW has a positive effect on rents 
    whereas the residence MW has a negative effect.
    We construct a ZIP-code-by-month panel using rents data from Zillow, and
    use a difference-in-differences design to estimate the effect of 
    residence and workplace MW changes on log median housing rents.
    Our baseline results imply that a ZIP code experiencing a 
    10 percent increase in the workplace MW and 
    no change in the residence MW will have a contemporaneous increase in rents 
    of $\BothBetaBaseTen$ percent (SE=$\BothBetaBaseTenSE$).
    If the residence MW also increases by 10 percent, then 
    rents will increase by $\BothSumBaseTen$ percent (SE=$\BothSumBaseTenSE$).
    We use our results to study the consequences of a counterfactual increase in 
    the federal MW from \$7.25 to \$9.
    In ZIP codes where the residence MW increases landlords pocket on average 
    $\rhoMeanCentsDirFedNine$ cents on the extra dollar generated by the policy.
    In ZIP codes where the residence MW does not change, landlords pocket 
    on average $\rhoMeanCentsIndirFedNine$ cents.
