\begin{abstract}
    \noindent
    The US has seen a marked increase in state and local minimum wage (MW) policies 
    in the past 10 years.
    This trend highlights the importance of recognizing the placed-based nature of 
    MW policies for evaluating their welfare effects.
    In this paper, we take a step in that direction by studying the effect of MW 
    increases on housing rents leveraging variation within metropolitan areas.
    To do so, we use high-frequency (monthly) data at the ZIP code level from Zillow.
    Our empirical strategy relies on two-way FE models that include ``statutory'' 
    MW changes and a novel measure of ``experienced'' MW changes based on commuting
    shares.
    We theoretically argue that accounting for both enriches our understanding of 
    the effects on rents and helps identification.
    Our results indicate that a ZIP code experiencing a 10 percent increase in 
    experienced MW and no change in statutory MW will have an increase in rents of
    between 0.7 and 1 percent.
    If statutory MW also increases by 10 percent within that same ZIP code, the 
    increase in rents would be between 0.3 and 0.6 percent.
    Our estimates imply that landlords pocket at least 22 percent of the extra income 
    generated by the MW increase.
