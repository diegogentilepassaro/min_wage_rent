\begin{abstract}
    \noindent
    Recently many state and substate minimum wage (MW) policies have been 
    instituted in the US, resulting in significant dispersion of MW levels 
    within metropolitan areas.
    In this paper we study the effect of MW changes on local housing rental 
    markets exploiting the placed-based nature of MW policies.
    For each location we define both
    the log minimum wage where the average resident works (the ``workplace MW'')
    and the log minimum wage in the location itself (the ``residence MW'').
    We write down a partial-equilibrium model of a housing market
    in which minimum wage levels in each location affect housing demand by 
    changing the income of commuters and the prices of non-tradable consumption. 
    We show that, in the model, the workplace MW has a positive effect on rents 
    whereas the residence MW has a negative effect.
    We take our model to the data by constructing a ZIP code monthly panel 
    using rents data from Zillow.
    We use a difference-in-differences design to estimate the effect of 
    residence and workplace MW changes on log median housing rents.
    We find that a ZIP code experiencing a 10 percent increase in workplace MW
    and no change in residence MW will have an increase in rents of between 
    0.65 and 1.2 percent.
    If the residence MW also increases by 10 percent, then the increase in 
    rents will be lower---between 0.35 and 0.9 percent---.
    We use our results to study the consequences of a counterfactual increase in 
    the federal MW from \$7.25 to \$9.
    We estimate that, in ZIP codes where the residence MW increases, landlords 
    pocket between 5 and 9 cents on the extra dollar.
    In ZIP codes where the residence MW does not change, landlords pocket between 
    9 and 16 cents.
    %DGP: Not sure about this last sentence but we can change this after we write the counterfactual sectrion.
