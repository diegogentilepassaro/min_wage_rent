\begin{abstract}
    \noindent
    The US has seen a marked increase in the number of state and substate minimum 
    wage (MW) policies in the past 10 years, resulting in significant dispersion 
    of MW levels within states and metropolitan areas.
    In this paper we study the effect of MW changes on local housing rental 
    markets exploiting the placed-based nature of MW policies.
    We start by constructing a novel measure of exposure to MW policies based on 
    commuting shares, which we call the ``workplace MW.''
    We write down a simple partial-equilibrium model and we show that our measure of 
    exposure to the MW increases rents, and that the ``residence MW'' 
    (i.e., the statutory one) reduces disposable income and thus has a negative effects on rents.
    We take our model to the data by constructing a ZIP code monthly panel using 
    rents data from Zillow.
    Exploiting the high frequency and resolution of our data, we estimate the 
    effect of residence and workplace MW changes on rents jointly 
    using a first difference model with two-way fixed effects that is tantamount
    to a difference-in-differences approach.
    Our results indicate that a ZIP code experiencing a 10 percent increase in 
    workplace MW and no change in residence MW will have an increase in rents of 
    between 0.65 and 1.2 percent. If statutory MW also increases by 10 percent 
    within that same ZIP code, then the increase in rents will only be between 
    0.35 and 0.9 percent.
    We use our results to study the consequences of a counterfactual
    increase in the federal MW from \$7.25 to \$9.
    We estimate that, in ZIP codes where the binding MW goes from \$7.25 to \$9,
    landlords pocket between 5 and 9 cents on the extra dollar. In ZIP codes 
    where the binding MW does not change, landlords pocket between 9 and 16 cents.
