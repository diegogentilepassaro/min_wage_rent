\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
    \noindent
    Recently many state and substate minimum wage (MW) policies have been 
    instituted in the US, resulting in significant dispersion of MW levels within 
    metropolitan areas.
    In this paper we study the effect of MW changes on local housing rental 
    markets exploiting the placed-based nature of MW policies.
    We construct a novel measure of exposure to MW policies based on commuting 
    shares, which we call a ZIP code's ``workplace MW.''
    We write down a partial-equilibrium model and show that the workplace MW 
    increases rents, whereas the ``residence MW'' (i.e., the statutory one) has 
    a negative effect on rents.
    We take our model to the data by constructing a ZIP code monthly panel using 
    rents data from Zillow.
    We use a difference-in-differences design to estimate the effect of residence 
    and workplace MW changes on median housing rents.
    We find that a ZIP code experiencing a 10 percent increase in workplace MW and 
    no change in residence MW will have an increase in rents of between 0.65 and 
    1.2 percent.
    If statutory MW also increases by 10 percent within that same ZIP code, then 
    the increase in rents will only be between 0.35 and 0.9 percent.
    We use our results to study the consequences of a counterfactual increase in 
    the federal MW from \$7.25 to \$9.
    We estimate that, in ZIP codes where the statutory MW increases, landlords 
    pocket between 5 and 9 cents on the extra dollar. In ZIP codes where the 
    binding MW does not change, landlords pocket between 9 and 16 cents.
