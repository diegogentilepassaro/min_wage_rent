\begin{abstract}
    \noindent
    The US has seen a marked increase in the number of state and substate minimum 
    wage (MW) policies in the past 10 years, resulting in significant dispersion 
    of MW levels within metropolitan areas.
    In this paper we study the effect of MW changes on the local housing rental 
    markets exploiting the placed-based nature of MW policies.
    We start by constructing a novel measure of exposure to MW policies based on 
    commuting shares, which we call a ZIP code's ``workplace MW.''
    We write down a simple partial-equilibrium model in which our measure of 
    exposure to the MW increases rents, and the ``residence MW'' (i.e., the same 
    location one) has a negative partial effect.
    We take our model to the data by constructing a ZIP code monthly panel using 
    rents data from Zillow.
    We estimate the effect of residence and workplace MW changes on rents jointly 
    using two-way fixed effect models.
    Our results indicate that a ZIP code experiencing a 10 percent increase in 
    workplace MW and no change in residence MW will have an increase in rents of 
    between 0.65 and 1.2 percent, depending on the specification.
    If statutory MW also increases by 10 percent within that same ZIP code, then
    the increase in rents will only be between 0.35 and 0.9 percent.
    We use our estimated model to study the consequences of a counterfactual
    increase in the federal MW from \$7.25 to \$9.
    We find large variations in the effects of this policy on rents.
    We estimate that, in ZIP codes where the binding MW goes from \$7.25 to \$9,
    landlords pocket between 5 and 8 cents on the dollar.
    However, in ZIP codes where the binding MW does not change, the share pocketed
    by landlords is higher.
