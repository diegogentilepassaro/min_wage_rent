\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
    \noindent
    Recently, many state and substate minimum wage (MW) policies have been 
    instituted in the US, resulting in significant dispersion of MW levels 
    within metropolitan areas.
    In this paper, we study the effect of MW changes on local housing rental 
    markets exploiting the placed-based nature of MW policies.
    We argue that commuting patterns are key to understanding the effect of these
    policies across locations.
    For each location we define both
    the log MW where the average resident works (the ``workplace MW'')
    and the log MW in the location itself (the ``residence MW'').
    We derive a partial-equilibrium model of a housing market
    in which MW levels in each location affect housing demand by 
    changing the income of commuters and the prices of non-tradable consumption. 
    The model shows that the workplace MW has a positive effect on rents 
    whereas the residence MW has a negative effect.
    We take our model to the data by constructing a ZIP-code-by-month panel 
    using rents data from Zillow.
    We use a difference-in-differences design to estimate the effect of 
    residence and workplace MW changes on log median housing rents.
    Our baseline results imply that a ZIP code experiencing a 
    10 percent increase in the workplace MW and 
    no change in the residence MW will have an increase in rents of 
    $\BothBetaBaseTen$ percent (SE=$\BothBetaBaseTenSE$).
    If the residence MW also increases by 10 percent, then 
    rents will increase by $\BothSumBaseTen$ percent (SE=$\BothSumBaseTenSE$).

    We use our results to study the consequences of a counterfactual increase in 
    the federal MW from \$7.25 to \$9.
    Assuming a share of housing expenditure of 0.35 we estimate that, 
    in ZIP codes where the residence MW increases, 
    landlords pocket on average 10.5 cents on the extra dollar generated by the
    policy.
    In ZIP codes where the residence MW does not change, landlords pocket 
    on average 17.6 cents.
