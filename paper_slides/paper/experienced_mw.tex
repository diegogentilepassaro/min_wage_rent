Thus far we have used the statutory minimum wage as our variable of interest. More 
precisely, we took the maximum across federal, state and local minimum wage as our 
treatment of interest. However, what matters for the a zipcode's housing market is 
the wage of the people residing there, which may not coincide with the statutory MW
if workers actually work in different zipcodes.

Therefore, we construct a new measure of the ``effective'' minimum wage in each zipcode 
that takes into account the fact that MW workers residence may differ from workplace 
location.

%% DESCRIBE HOW WE CONSTRUCT THE WEIGHTS

As an illustration, figure \ref{fig:expmw_san_diego} plots the statutory versus experienced 
MW variables following the California increase in the minimum wage on January, 2019. As of 
December 2018 the MW in San Diego city was \$11.50, whereas the state's MW binding outside 
the city was \$11.\footnote{For employers larger than 26 employees. For those below 26 
	employees the level was \$10.50.}
The increase in the state level MW to \$12 in January 2020 appears as a discontinuity in the 
city border. However, when we account for the fact that MW workers commute, we observe a 
gradient in the intensity of the policy.
