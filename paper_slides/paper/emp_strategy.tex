\subsection{First-differences model}

Consider the following two-way fixed effects model relating rents and the 
minimum wage:
\begin{equation*} \label{eq:did_lev}
    r_{it} = \alpha_i + \hat{\delta}_t 
           + \gamma \mw^{\res}_{it} + \beta \mw^{\wkp}_{it}
           + \mathbf{X}^{'}_{it}\eta
           + \varepsilon_{it} \ 
\end{equation*}    
where
$i$ and $t$ index ZIP codes and time periods (months),
$r_{it}$ represents the log of rents per square foot,
$\mw^{\res}_{it}$ is the ZIP code's residence MW, defined as 
$\ln \MW_{it}$,
$\mw^{\wkp}_{it}$ is the ZIP code's workplace MW, defined as 
$\sum_{z\in\Z(i)} \pi_{iz}\ln \MW_{zt}$,
$\alpha_i$ and $\hat{\delta}_t$ are fixed effects, and 
$\mathbf{X}_{it}$ is a vector of county-level time-varying controls.
Time runs from February 2010 ($\underline{T}$) to December 2019 ($\overline{T}$).
The parameters of interest are $\gamma$ and $\beta$, which we interpret as the 
elasticity of rents to the residence and workplace MW, respectively.

By taking first differences on the previous equation we obtain
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fd}
    \Delta r_{it} = \delta_t
                  + \gamma \Delta \mw^{\res}_{it} + \beta \Delta \mw^{\wkp}_{it}
                  + \Delta \mathbf{X}^{'}_{it}\eta
                  + \Delta \varepsilon_{it} ,
\end{equation}
where $\delta_t = \hat{\delta}_t - \hat{\delta}_{t-1}$.
We spell out the model in first differences because it is reasonable to expect 
unobserved shocks to rental prices to be persistent over time. 
Appendix Table XX shows evidence of AR(1) auto-correlation in the error term.

The main results of the paper are obtained under the model in \ref{eq:fd}. 
However, to compare to previous results we also estimate versions of the model
that exclude some of the MW measures.



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Identification and Causality}

We start by noting that, in order to separately identify the effect of 
residence and workplace MW changes, we need these variables to have independent
variation.
While this requirement is standard, it is not obvious that it holds in our
application.
For instance, if there were a single national minimum wage level or if everybody 
lived and worked in the same location, then we would have
$\Delta \mw^{\res}_{it} = \Delta \mw^{\wkp}_{it}$ for all $(i,t)$.
In the next section we show that there is substantial independent variation
in the MW measures.

Being able to compute $\gamma$ and $\beta$ does not mean that they can be given
a causal interpretation.
For this, we require a \textit{strict exogeneity} of both MW variables.
Formally,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:strict_exogeneity}
    E\left[
        \begin{pmatrix}
            \Delta \mw^{\res}_{is} \\
            \Delta \mw^{\wkp}_{is} \\
        \end{pmatrix}
        \Delta \varepsilon_{it}
    \bigg| \delta_t, \Delta \mathbf{X}_{it} \right] =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        0 \\
        0 \\
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
for all $s\in\{\underline{T}, ..., \overline{T}\}$.
That is, we require the unobserved shocks to rents to be uncorrelated with 
past and present values of changes in our MW measures 
conditional on time-period fixed effects and controls.

This assumption has two important implications.
First,
it implies no pre-trends in rents leading up to minimum wage changes 
(conditional on controls). We will test this implication more formally by 
including leads of the MW variables.
Second,
it rules out feedback effects from current values of rents on our MW variables, 
i.e., MW changes are assumed not to be influenced by past values of rents.
While we think this is a reasonable assumption---MW levels are usually not 
set by considering their effects on the housing market---, we allow this type of 
feedback effects in a specification described later.
Finally, we note that our identifying assumption allows for arbitrary 
correlation between ZIP code effects $\alpha_i$ and both MW variables
(e.g., our empirical strategy is robust to the fact that richer districts tend 
to vote for MW policies).

We worry that unobserved shocks, such as local business cycles, may 
systematically affect both rents and minimum wage changes, which is why
we include period-fixed effects and time-varying controls.
The period fixed effects should capture common trends in the housing market.
In some specifications we allow this trends to vary by CBSA.
To control for variation arising from unobserved trends in local markets we 
include economic controls from the QCEW.%
\footnote{These data are aggregated at the county level, and represent a second best given the 
unavailability of controls at the ZIP code level.}
Specifically, we use average weekly wages, employment and establishment counts 
for the sectors ``Professional and business services,'' ``Information,'' and 
``Financial activities.''
We assume that these sectors are not affected by the minimum wage.%
\footnote{In fact, according to \textcite[][table 5]{MinWorkersReportBLS}, in 
2019 such industries accounted for 3.5, 1, and 1.2 percent of the total number 
of MW workers, respectively.}
We also try models where we control for ZIP code-specific linear and quadratic 
trends, which should account for time-varying heterogeneity not captured by our 
economic controls that follows this pattern.

We can test assumption \ref{eq:strict_exogeneity} using models that include 
leads and lags of the MW variables:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:leads_lags}
    \Delta r_{it} = \delta_t
                  + \sum_{r=-s}^{s} \gamma_s \Delta \mw^{\res}_{is} 
                  + \sum_{r=-s}^{s} \beta_s \Delta \mw^{\wkp}_{is}
                  + \Delta \mathbf{X}^{'}_{it}\eta
                  + \Delta \varepsilon_{it} .
\end{equation}
In this equation $s$ is the number of months of a symmetric window around the 
MW change. 
We use $s=6$ as baseline but our results are very similar for windows of 3 or 9 
months.
%%% SH:
%%%     How should we go about the figure that showed the results for different
%%%     windows
Because the MW measures are strongly correlated, adding leads and lags of both 
leads to a decline in precision.
Thus, we try models with leads and lags of only one of the MW measures as well.

Under the assumption that there are no anticipatory effects in the housing 
market, we interpret the absence of pre-trends as evidence against the presence 
of unobserved economic shocks driving our results.
We think that, given the high frequency of our data and that we focus on short 
windows around MW changes, the assumption of no anticipatory effects is 
reasonable.%
\footnote{We can also interpret the absence of pre-trends as a test for 
anticipatory effects if we are willing to assume that the controls embedded in 
$\mathbf{X}_{ct}$ capture all relevant unobserved heterogeneity arising from 
local business cycles.
While we find the interpretation given in the text more palatable, the data is 
consistent with both.}
We further present evidence in favor of this assumption by showing that our MW 
measures do not predict the number of listings of houses for sale in Zillow.%
%% SH:
%%%    Update this analysis
\footnote{Ideally, we would run this regression on the number of rental units.
Unfortunately this information is not available in the data.
Specifically, we track the number of houses listed for sale in a sample of ZIP 
codes during the period 2013-2019 for our preferred house type (SFCC).}

As written, the model in \ref{eq:fd} assumes a balanced panel of ZIP codes.
However, as explained in Section XX   %% Refer to last part of data section
we use as our baseline a partially balanced panel.
This estimation is valid under a stronger version of \ref{eq:strict_exogeneity},
where we also condition on sample selection.
If MW changes and rents change together in a systematic way upon entry of a 
ZIP code to the data, then our results would be invalid.
Because of this we show that our results are similar when we estimate our model
on a fully balanced panel.
Our results are also similar under an unbalanced panel where we include for 
time-of-entry fixed effects.

\subsection{Identification beyond the MW measures}

As stated earlier, to be able to compute $\gamma$ and $\beta$ we require the 
residence and workplace MW measures to vary independently within each period.
Furthermore, we require the strict exogeneity assumption to assure that our
estimates will capture the population coefficients.
However, it is not totally clear what these assumptions mean for the underlying 
commuting shares and the dynamics of unobserved heterogeneity in trends for the 
most common treatment in our data: 
an increase in the minimum wage of a city or state that affects a subset of the 
ZIP codes in a metropolitan area.

Following such a policy there will be ZIP codes where the residence MW goes up
and ZIP codes where it does not.
We call ZIP codes in the first group ``directly treated.''
Appendix \ref{sec:did_spillovers_id} shows that, for this policy, 
$\beta$ and $\gamma$ can be computed under the following assumptions: 
1) parallel trends between ZIP codes that are directly treated and ZIP codes 
that are not;
2) the existence of two groups of ZIP codes that are not treated directly and
have differential exposue to the policy via the commuting shares; and 
3) parallel trends between those two groups.

\subsection{Alternative models}


Inspired by this approach, we use a stacked sample in Appendix Table XX.

Appendix Table XX shows that we obtain similar results under a weaker 
\textit{sequential exogeneity} assumption \parencite{ArellanoHonore2001}.
