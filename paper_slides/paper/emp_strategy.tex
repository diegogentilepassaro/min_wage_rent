%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In this section we discuss our empirical strategy.
We start with an intuitive presentation of our identification argument, which
is formalized in an appendix.
Next, we specialize our discussion under the functional form suggested by
the model in Section \ref{sec:model}.
We also discuss alternative estimation strategies, concerns related to
the sample of ZIP codes we use, and heterogeneity of estimated effects.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Intuitive Identification Argument}

Our data consist of rents, the residence and workplace MW measures, and 
economic controls.
The residence and workplace MW measures are our two continuous treatment 
variables, and we use a difference-in-differences strategy to estimate their 
effects on rents.
We estimate the effect of the residence MW from the slope of the relationship 
between the residence MW and rents using places with a similar level of the 
workplace MW.
Intuitively, we condition on the workplace MW and compare places with slightly
different residence MW levels.
Likewise, we estimate the effect of the workplace MW from the slope of the 
relationship between the workplace MW and rents conditioning on locations 
with a similar level of the residence MW.

For these slopes to correspond to the causal effect of each MW measure on rents 
we need to make two assumptions.
The first assumption is a form of \textit{parallel trends}: among ZIP codes with 
the same workplace MW, ZIP codes with higher and lower residence MW levels would 
have had parallel trends in rents if not for the change in the residence MW.
The second assumption is \textit{no selection on gains}: ZIP codes that receive
different levels of the residence MW must experience a similar treatment effect
on average, conditional again on the workplace MW.
We need these assumptions to hold for the workplace MW as well.
Online Appendix \ref{sec:potential_outcomes} formalizes these assumptions in a 
potential outcomes framework following \textcite{CallawayEtAl2021}.
We discuss the plausibility of these assumptions in the next subsection.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Parametric Model}

Consider the two-way fixed effects model relating rents and the MW measures
given by
\begin{equation} \label{eq:func_form}
    r_{it} = \alpha_i + \tilde{\delta}_t 
           + \gamma \mw^{\res}_{it} + \beta \mw^{\wkp}_{it}
           + \mathbf{X}^{'}_{it}\eta
           + \upsilon_{it} ,
\end{equation}    
where
$i$ and $t$ index ZIP codes and time periods (months), respectively,
$r_{it}$ represents the log of rents per square foot,
$\mw^{\res}_{it} = \ln \MW_{it}$ is the ZIP code's residence MW,
$\mw^{\wkp}_{it} = \sum_{z\in\Z(i)} \pi_{iz}\ln \MW_{zt}$ is the ZIP code's 
workplace MW,
$\alpha_i$ and $\tilde{\delta}_t$ are fixed effects, and 
$\mathbf{X}_{it}$ is a vector of time-varying controls.
Time runs from January 2015 $\left(\underline{T}\right)$ 
to December 2019 $\left(\overline{T}\right)$.
The parameters of interest are $\gamma$ and $\beta$ which, 
following the model in Section \ref{sec:model}, 
we interpret as the elasticity of rents to the residence MW and the workplace MW, 
respectively.

By taking first differences in equation \eqref{eq:func_form} we obtain
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fd}
    \Delta r_{it} = \delta_t
                  + \gamma \Delta \mw^{\res}_{it} + \beta \Delta \mw^{\wkp}_{it}
                  + \Delta \mathbf{X}^{'}_{it}\eta
                  + \Delta \upsilon_{it} ,
\end{equation}
where $\delta_t = \tilde{\delta}_t - \tilde{\delta}_{t-1}$.
We estimate the model in first differences because we expect unobserved shocks
to rental prices to be serially autocorrelated over time, making the levels
model less efficient.
Online Appendix Table \ref{tab:autocorrelation} shows strong evidence of serial 
auto-correlation in the error term of the model in levels.
While estimated coefficients are similar in levels and in first differences, 
standard errors are seven to nine times larger in the former.

A standard requirement for a linear model like \eqref{eq:fd} to be
estimable is a rank condition, which implies that both MW measures must have 
independent variation, conditional on the controls.
For instance, if there were a single national minimum wage level or if everybody 
lived and worked in the same location, then we would have
$\Delta \mw^{\res}_{it} = \Delta \mw^{\wkp}_{it}$ for all $(i,t)$.
If so, $\gamma$ and $\beta$ could not be separately identified.
We check in the data that the rank condition is satisfied.

The main results of the paper are obtained under the model in \eqref{eq:fd}. 
In order to compare with the literature we also estimate versions of the 
model that exclude either one of the MW measures.

\subsubsection*{Identification}

The model in \eqref{eq:func_form} imposes a linear functional form.
Assuming that the true data generating process has this property rules out 
selection on gains, since then ZIP codes receiving a particular level of the
MW measures will experience the same (constant) effect than ZIP codes that 
receive a different level.
This is one of the assumptions required for identification according to 
Online Appendix \ref{sec:potential_outcomes}.
We view this as a reasonable assumption.
For it not to hold, workers would need to anticipate not only future MW policies 
but also how future rental markets would be affected by them given the commuting 
structure, and select their residence so that rents react differently to the 
MW in different ZIP codes with similar levels of the MW measures.
We show in the next section that the (conditional) slope of log rents with 
respect to each of the MW measures appears linear, suggesting that the 
assumption of no selection on gains is plausible.

For estimates of $\beta$ and $\gamma$ to have a causal interpretation we need 
another assumption: the error term $\Delta\upsilon_{it}$ must be 
\textit{strictly exogenous} with respect to the MW measures.
In other words, the unobserved shocks to rents must be uncorrelated with past 
and present values of changes in our MW measures.
This is in the spirit of parallel trends, the second assumption required for
identification in the potential outcomes framework of Online Appendix 
\ref{sec:potential_outcomes}.
This assumption implies that rents prior to a change in either MW measure must
evolve in parallel.
We test for pre-trends adding leads and lags of either one of the MW measures 
at a time in \eqref{eq:fd}.%
\footnote{For instance, for the workplace MW we estimate
\begin{equation*}
    \Delta r_{it} = \delta_t
                  + \gamma \Delta \mw^{\res}_{it} 
                  + \sum_{k=-s}^{s} \beta_k \Delta \mw^{\wkp}_{ik}
                  + \Delta \mathbf{X}^{'}_{it}\eta
                  + \Delta \upsilon_{it} ,
\end{equation*}
where $s=6$.
Our results are very similar for different values of the window $s$.}
We do so because Online Appendix \ref{sec:potential_outcomes} suggests that we 
only need to condition on the current level of one of the MW measures for 
parallel trends of the other measure to hold (see Assumption \ref{assu:PT}).
A second reason is that the residence MW and workplace MW are strongly 
correlated.
Including leads and lags of both measures results in standard errors that are
two to four times larger, diminishing the power of the pre-trends test.

A second implication of the strict exogenity assumption is that it rules out 
feedback effects from current values of rents on our MW variables, 
i.e., MW changes are assumed not to be influenced by past values of rent changes.
While we think that this is a reasonable assumption---MW policies are rarely 
set taking into account their effects on housing markets---, we allow for this 
type of feedback effects in a specification described in the following subsection.
Finally, we note that the strict exogeneity assumption allows for arbitrary 
correlation between $\alpha_i$ and both MW variables 
(e.g., our empirical strategy is robust to the fact that districts with more
expensive housing tend to vote for MW policies).

We worry that unobserved shocks, such as those caused by local business cycles, 
may systematically affect both rent changes and MW changes.
To account for common trends in the housing market we include time-period 
fixed effects $\delta_t$, which in some specifications are allowed to vary by 
jurisdiction.
To control for variation arising from unobserved trends in local labor markets 
we include economic controls from the QCEW $\mathbf{X}_{it}$.%
\footnote{These data are aggregated at the county level, and represent a second 
best given the unavailability of local business cycle data at the ZIP code 
level.}
Specifically, we control for average weekly wage and establishment counts at the 
county-quarter level, and for employment counts at the county-month level, 
for the sectors ``Professional and business services,'' ``Information,'' and 
``Financial activities.''%
\footnote{We assume that these sectors are not affected by the MW.
In fact, according to the \textcite[][Table 5]{MinWorkersReportBLS}, in 
2019 the percent of workers paid an hourly rate at or below the federal MW 
in those industries was 0.8, 1.5, and 0.2, respectively.
In comparison, 9.5 percent of workers in ``Leisure and hospitality'' were paid 
an hourly rate at or below the federal MW.}
We also try models where we control for ZIP code-specific linear
trends, which should account for time-varying heterogeneity not controlled for 
by our economic controls that follows a linear pattern.
Under the assumption that there are no anticipatory effects in the housing 
market, we interpret the absence of pre-trends as evidence against the presence 
of unobserved economic shocks driving our results.
Given the high frequency of our data and the focus on short windows around 
MW changes, the assumption of no anticipatory effects seems plausible.%
\footnote{We can also interpret the absence of pre-trends as a test for 
anticipatory effects if we are willing to assume that the controls embedded in 
$\mathbf{X}_{it}$ capture all relevant unobserved heterogeneity arising from 
local business cycles.
While we find the interpretation given in the text more palatable, the data are 
consistent with both.}
% We further present evidence in favor of this assumption by showing that our MW 
% measures do not predict the number of listings of houses for sale in Zillow.%
% \footnote{Ideally, we would run this regression on the number of rental units.
% Unfortunately this information is not available in the Zillow data.
% Specifically, we track the number of houses listed for sale in a sample of ZIP 
% codes during the period 2013-2019 for our preferred house type (SFCC).}

\subsection{Alternative Strategies}\label{sec:alt_emp_strategies}

Recent literature has shown that usual estimators in a difference-in-differences 
setting do not correspond to well-define average treatment effects when the 
treatment roll-out is staggered and there is treatment-effect heterogeneity 
\parencite{deChaisemartinEtAl2022,RothEtAl2022}.
While our setting does not correspond exactly to the models discussed in this
literature, we worry about the validity of our estimator.%
\footnote{\textcite[][Section 3.4]{CallawayEtAl2021} discusses the properties 
of the TWFE estimator in the context of a single continuous treatment.}
To ease these concerns, in an appendix we construct a ``stacked'' implementation 
of equation \eqref{eq:fd} in which we take six months of data around MW changes 
for ZIP codes in CBSAs where some ZIP codes received a direct MW change and 
some did not, 
and then estimate the model on this restricted sample including event-by-time 
fixed effects.
This strategy limits the comparisons used to compute the coefficients of 
interest to ZIP codes within the same metropolitan area and event.

In a separate exercise we relax the strict exogeneity assumption.
We do so in an appendix, where we propose a model that includes the lagged 
rents variable as control.
In such a model, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ have a causal interpretation under a 
weaker \textit{sequential exogeneity} assumption
\parencite{ArellanoBond1991, ArellanoHonore2001}.
This alternative assumption requires innovations to rents to be uncorrelated 
only with past changes in the MW measures, and thus allows for feedback of 
rent shocks onto MW changes in future periods.
We estimate this model using an IV strategy in which the first lag of the change
in rents is instrumented with the second lag.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Sample Selection Concerns and Heterogeneity}\label{sec:emp_start_heterogeneity}

As explained in Section \ref{sec:data_final_panel}, 
the model in equation \eqref{eq:fd} is estimated using a balanced panel.
In an alternative estimation exercise we use an unbalanced panel with all 
ZIP codes with Zillow rental data in the SFCC category 
from February 2010 to December 2019, controlling for time period by 
quarterly date of entry fixed effects.
However, even all ZIP codes available in the Zillow data may be 
a selected sample of the set of urban ZIP codes.
To approximate the average treatment effect in urban ZIP codes we follow
\textcite{Hainmueller2012} and estimate our main models re-weighting 
observations to match key moments of the distribution of characteristics of 
those.

As a separate exercise, we explore heterogeneity of our results with respect
to pre-determined variables.
If the mechanism proposed in Section \ref{sec:model} is correct, then we
expect the effect of the residence MW to be stronger in locations where many 
workers earn close to the MW.
The reason is that the production of non-tradable goods presumably uses more
low-wage work, and thus the increase in the MW would affect prices more.
Similarly, we expect the effect of the workplace MW to be stronger in locations
with lots of MW workers as residents since income would increase more 
strongly there.
We then estimate the following model:
\begin{equation*}\label{eq:fd_heterogeneity}
    \Delta r_{it} = \Xi_t
                  + \tilde\gamma_0 \Delta \mw^{\res}_{it}
                  + \tilde\gamma_1 \iota_i \Delta \mw^{\res}_{it}
                  + \tilde\beta_0 \Delta \mw^{\wkp}_{it}
                  + \tilde\beta_1 \iota_i \Delta \mw^{\wkp}_{it}
                  + \Delta \mathbf{X}^{'}_{it}\tilde\eta
                  + \Delta \tilde\upsilon_{it} ,
\end{equation*}
where $\iota_i$ represents the standardized share of MW workers residing in $i$.
Because we cannot estimate the share of MW workers working in a given location,
we interact both the residence and workplace MW with the share of MW residents
according to the MW in the location.%
\footnote{We discuss our estimates of the share of MW workers who reside in each 
location in Section \ref{sec:data_income_housing}.}
We conduct a similar exercise using median household income and the share of 
public housing units.
