        Notes: Data on rents are from Zillow (YYY), on statutory minimum wage levels
        from \textcite{VaghulZipperer2016, BerkeleyLaborCenter}, and on commuting 
        shares from LODES (YYYY).
        The table shows results for models estimated using a ``stacked'' sample.
        To construct the sample we proceed as follows.
        First, we define a CBSA-month as treated if in that month there is at least one ZIP 
        code that had a change in the binding MW.
        For each of the selected CBSA-months we assign a unique event ID. 
        Second, for each event we take a window $w = 6$, and we keep all months within that 
        window for the ZIP codes that belong to the treated CBSA.
        If a ZIP code has missing data for some month within the window, we drop the entire 
        ZIP code from the respective event.
