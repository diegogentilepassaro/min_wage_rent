        Notes: 
        Data are from the baseline estimation sample described in Section 
        \ref{sec:data_final_panel}.
        The table mimicks the estimates in Table \ref{tab:static} but using a 
        ``stacked'' sample.
        To construct the sample we proceed as follows.
        First, we define a CBSA-month as treated if in that month there is at 
        least one ZIP code that had a change in the binding MW.
        For each of the selected CBSA-months we assign a unique event ID. 
        Second, for each event we take a window $w = 6$, and we keep all months 
        within that window for the ZIP codes that belong to the treated CBSA.
        If a ZIP code has missing data for some month within the window, we drop 
        the entire ZIP code from the respective event.
        For each column, we estimate the same model as the analogous column in 
        Table \ref{tab:static} but include event indicator $\times$ year-month
        fixed effects.
