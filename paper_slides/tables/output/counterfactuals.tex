        Notes: 
        Data are from LODES origin-destination statistics, 
        Small Area Fair Market Rents, 
        IRS ZIP code aggregate statistics, and 
        the MW panel described in Section \ref{sec:data_mw_panel}.
        The table shows the median of the estimated ZIP code-specific shares of 
        the additional income pocketed by landlords (``Share pocketed''), 
        defined as the ratio of the increase in income to the increase in rents,
        for different groups of ZIP codes.
        Panel A is based on a counterfactual increase from \$7.25 to \$9 in the 
        federal MW in January 2020, holding constant other MW policies in their 
        December 2019 levels.
        Panel B is based on a counterfactual increase from \$13 to \$14 in the 
        Chicago City MW, also holding constant other MW policies.
        In the last row of each panel, we report the total incidence of the 
        counterfactual policy.
        We also report the median change in residence MW, change in workplace MW,
        and share of ZIP code-specific housing expenditure ``Share of housing 
        exp.'') defined in Online Appendix \ref{sec:measure_housing_expenditure}.
        Increases in income and rents are simulated following the procedure 
        described in Section \ref{sec:counterfactual}.
        We assume the following parameter values: 
        $\beta = \betaCf$, $\gamma = \gammaCf$, and $\varepsilon = \epsilonCf$.
        Panel A includes urban ZIP codes only and excludes ZIP codes located 
        in $\cbsaLowIncFedNine$ CBAs for which the average estimated change in 
        log total wage income was below 0.1.
        Panel B includes all ZIP codes with valid data in the 
        Chicago-Naperville-Elgin CBSA.
