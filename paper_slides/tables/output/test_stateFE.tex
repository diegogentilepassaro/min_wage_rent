        Notes: 
        Data are from the baseline estimation sample.
        The measure of rents per square foot corresponds to the Single Family, 
        Condominium and Cooperative houses from Zillow.
        Let ``$\text{st}$'' denote the model with state by year-month fixed effects,
        and ``$\text{base}$ ''the baseline model.
        Then, the first row tests the null $\beta^{\text{st}} - \beta^{\text{base}} = 0$,
        whereas the second row tests the null $\gamma^{\text{st}} - \gamma^{\text{base}} = 0$.
        The first column shows point estimates of the model with state by year-month 
        fixed effects.
        The second column shows point estimates of the baseline model.
        The third column shows the value of the difference of the relevant coefficients,
        and the fourth column shows the standard error of the difference.
        The fifth and sixth columns show the implied $t$- and $p$-values.
        We constructed these tests by estimating both regression equations jointly, 
        including economic controls from the QCEW as in the paper.
        Standard errors in parentheses are clustered at the state level.
