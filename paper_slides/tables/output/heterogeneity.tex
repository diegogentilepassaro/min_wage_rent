        \textit{Notes}: 
        Data are from the baseline estimation sample described in Section 
        \ref{sec:data_final_panel}.
        In all columns we report the results of regressions of the log of median rents 
        per square foot on our MW-based measures.
        Column (1) reproduces estimates our baseline results from Table \ref{tab:static}.
        Column (2) presents estimates of our baseline model in which the residence MW 
        measure is fully interacted with the standardize share of minimum wage workers as 
        estimated Appendix \ref{sec:assigning_mw_levels}.
        Column (3) presents estimates of our baseline model in which the residence and 
        the workplace MW measures are interacted with the standardized median household income 
        from the 5-year 2010-2014 American Community Survey \parencite[ACS;][]{CensusACS}.
        Column (4) presents estimates of our baseline model in which the residence and 
        the workplace MW measures are interacted with an indicator that equals 1 if 
        the ZIP code has any public housing units in 2017. Public housing data are from \textcite{hudHousing}.
        Standard errors in parentheses are clustered at the state level.
