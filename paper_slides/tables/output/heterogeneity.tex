        \textit{Notes}: 
        Data are from the baseline estimation sample described in Section 
        \ref{sec:data_final_panel}.
        In all columns we report the results of regressions of the log of median rents 
        per square foot on our MW-based measures.
        Column (1) reproduces estimates our baseline results from Table \ref{tab:static}.
        Column (2) presents estimates of our baseline model in which the residence MW 
        measure is fully interacted with the percentage of minimum wage workers as estimated 
        Section XXX. 
        Column (3) presents estimates of our baseline model in which the residence and 
        the workplace MW measures are interacted with an indicator that equals 1 if 
        the ZIP code has any public housing units in 2017. Public housing data are from \textcite{hudHousing}.
        Column (4) presents estimates of our baseline model in which the residence and 
        the workplace MW measures are interacted with the median household income, in thousands of 
        US dollars, according to the 2014 American Community Survey.
        Both columns (2), (3), and (4) fully interact the MW measures and the fixed effects
        with the heterogeneity variables. The economic controls are not interacted with 
        the indicators.
        Standard errors in parentheses are clustered at the state level.
