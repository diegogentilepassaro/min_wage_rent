        \textit{Notes}: 
        Rents and MW data are from the baseline estimation sample described in Section 
        \ref{sec:data_final_panel}. Public housing data are from \ref{hudHousing}.
        In all columns we report the results of regressions of the log of 
        median rents per square foot on our MW-based measures.
        Column (1) presents estimates of our baseline model as explained in 
        \ref{sec:empirical_strategy}.
        Column (2), presents estimates of our baseline model in which the residence
        minimum wage measure is interacted with an indicator of high share of 
        MW workers and the Workplace minimum wage measure is interacted with an indicator
        of high share of MW residents.
        To define the above median indicators we do the following. Using LODES data, we 
        create an indicator for being above the median across ZIP codes for the share 
        of either residents or workers (i) with less than a high school diploma, and 
        (ii) that earn less than \$1250. We define high share of MW workers if the ZIP
        code is above median of both (i) and (ii) for the worker counts. Analogously we 
        define high share of MW residents if the ZIP code is above median of both (i) 
        and (ii) for the resident counts.
        Column (3)), presents estimates of our baseline model in which the residence and 
        the workplace minimum wage measures are interacted with an indicator of availability 
        of public housing units.
