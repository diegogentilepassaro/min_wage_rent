        Notes: 
        Data are from LODES and the minimum wage panel described in Section 
        \ref{sec:mw_construction}.
        The table shows averages of the estimated ZIP-code specific shares of the 
        additional income pocketed by landlords (``share pocketed''),
        defined as the ratio of the increase in income to the increase in rents.
        Increases in income and rents are simulated following the procedure
        described in Section \ref{sec:counterfactual}. 
        Panel A assumes a 10\% increase in the federal MW, and
        Panel B assumes an increase in the federal MW to \$15.
        We assume the following parameter values:
        $\beta = 0.0546$, $\gamma = -0.0207$, $\varepsilon = 0.1083$, and 
        $s\in\{0.25, 0.45\}$.
        We carry out our computations only for urban ZIP codes, defined as 
        those that belong to a CBSA with at least 80\% of urban population
        according to the 2010 census.
        The figure excludes ZIP codes located in CBAs for which the average
        estimated change in log total wages was below 0.1\% in the respective
        counterfactual scenario.
