        \textit{Notes}: 
        Data are from the baseline estimation sample described in Section 
        \ref{sec:data_final_panel}.
        Both columns report the results of regressions of the log of 
        median rents per square foot on our MW-based measures.
        Column (1) presents estimates of a model in levels, including 
        ZIP code and year-month fixed effects.
        Column (2), presents estimates of a model in first differences, 
        including year-month fixed effects 
        (note that the ZIP code fixed effect drops out).
        For the model in first differences, we also report the results of an 
        AR(1) auto-correlation test.
        We proceed as in \parencite[][Section 10.6.3]{wooldridge2010}.
        First, we compute the residuals of the model estimated in column (2), 
        and we regress those residuals on their lag.
        Let the auto-correlation coefficient of this model be $\rho$.
        The model in levels is efficient assuming no auto-correlation in the 
        error term, which would imply that the residuals of the 
        first-differenced model are auto-correlated with $\rho = -0.5$.
        The row ``P-value autocorrelation test'' reports the $p$-value of 
        a Wald test of that hypothesis.
