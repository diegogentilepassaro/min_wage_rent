        Notes: The table shows different estimations for the effect of the workplace minimum 
        wage on a ZIP code's log wage bill.
        The workplace minimum wage is the average in the year of the workplace minimum wage 
        defined in Section XX, using constant commuting shares as of 2017.
        Column (1) shows a two-way fixed effects model with no controls, where the fixed 
        effects are given by ZIP code and year.
        Column (2) adds the average in the year of the county-quarter economic controls from
        QCEW.
        Column (3) expands the model from column (2) interacting the year fixed effects 
        with CBSA indicators.
        Column (4) expands the model from column (2) interacting the year fixed effects 
        with county indicators.
        Column (5) uses the specification in column (4) on our baseline sample of ZIP codes,
        uses in Table \ref{tab:static}.
