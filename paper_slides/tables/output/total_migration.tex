        Notes: Commuting data are from LODES, and minimum wage 
        data are from the panel described in Section \ref{sec:mw_construction}.
        The table shows estimations of the effect of the workplace MW and
        residence MW on a ZIP code's number of workers, using four 
        different measures. 
        Columns (1) and (2) show the effect on the number of residents and 
        workers that work in the accommodation and food industry, while 
        columns (3) and (4) show the estimated effect on the number of 
        residents and workers that have an educational level lower than high 
        school. 
        All regressions include economic controls, zipcode fixed effects, 
        and CBSA by year fixed effects.
        The unit of observation is ZIP code by year.
        Standard errors in parentheses are clustered at the CBSA level.
