        Notes: Commuting data are from LODES, and minimum wage 
        data are from the panel described in Section \ref{sec:data_mw_measures}.
        The table shows estimations of the effect of the workplace MW and
        residence MW on a ZIP code's log number of workers and residents, 
        using six different measures. 
        Columns (1) and (2) show the effect on the log total number of workers 
        and residents in each zipcode.
        Columns (3) and (4) show the effect on the log number of workers and 
        residents that work in the accommodation and food industry, while 
        columns (5) and (6) show the estimated effect on the log number of 
        residents and workers that have an educational level lower than high 
        school. 
        All regressions include economic controls, zipcode fixed effects, 
        and CBSA by year fixed effects.
        The unit of observation is ZIP code by year.
        Standard errors in parentheses are clustered at the CBSA level.
