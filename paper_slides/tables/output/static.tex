        Notes:
        Data are from the baseline estimation sample described in Section 
        \ref{sec:data_final_panel}.
        Column (1) shows the results of a regression of the workplace MW measure
        on the residence MW measure.
        Column (2) through (4) show the results of regressions of the log of 
        median rents per square foot on our MW-based measures.
        All regressions are estimated in first differences and include 
        time-period fixed effects and economic controls that vary at the 
        county and month levels.
        The measure of rents per square foot correspond to the Single Family, 
        Condominium and Cooperative houses from Zillow.
        The residence MW is defined as the log statutory MW in the same ZIP code.
        The workplace MW is defined as the statutory MW where the average 
        resident of the ZIP code works, constructed using LODES 
        origin-destination data.
        Economic controls from the QCEW include the log of the average wage, 
        the log of employment, and the log of the establishment count from the 
        sectors ``Information'', ``Financial activities'', and ``Professional
        and business services''.
        Standard errors in parenthesis are clustered at the state level.
