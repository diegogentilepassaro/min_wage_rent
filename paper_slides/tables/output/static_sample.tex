        Notes:
        Data are from Zillow,
        the statutory MW panel described in Section \ref{sec:data_mw_panel},
        LODES origin-destination statistics, and the QCEW.
        Every column shows the results of regressions of the log of
        median rents per square foot on our MW-based measures.
        All regressions are estimated in first differences and include 
        time-period fixed effects and economic controls that vary at the 
        county by month and county by quarter levels.
        The measure of rents per square foot corresponds to the Single Family, 
        Condominium and Cooperative houses from Zillow.
        Columns (1) and (2) use our baseline sample defined in Section 
        \ref{sec:data_final_panel}.
        Column (3) uses the unbalanced sample of all ZIP codes with 
        Zillow rents data at any point in time, and controls for year of 
        entry to the panel by year-month fixed effects.
        Column (2) re-weights observations so that the sample of 
        ZIP codes in the data (column 3 of Table \ref{tab:stats_zip_samples}) 
        matches the averages of the set of ZIP codes located in urban CBSAs 
        (column 2 of Table \ref{tab:stats_zip_samples})
        in the following census variables:
        share of urban population
        share of renter-occupied households, and
        share of white population.
        Weights for each sample are computed following \textcite{Hainmueller2012}.
        Standard errors in parentheses are clustered at the state level.
