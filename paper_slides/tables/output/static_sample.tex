        Notes:
        Data are from Zillow \parencite{ZillowData}, 
        the statutory MW panel described in Section \ref{sec:mw_construction}, 
        LODES origin-destination statistics \parencite{CensusLODES},
        and the QCEW \parencite{QCEW}.
        Every column show the results of regressions of the log of 
        median rents per square foot on our MW-based measures.
        All regressions are estimated in first differences and include 
        time-period fixed effects and economic controls that vary at the 
        county and month levels.
        The measure of rents per square foot correspond to the Single Family, 
        Condominium and Cooperative houses from Zillow.
        Column (1) uses our baseline sample defined in Section 
        \ref{sec:data_final_panel}.
        Column (2) uses the unbalanced sample of all ZIP codes with Zillow rents 
        data at any point in time, and controls for year of entry to the panel
        $\times$ year-month fixed effects.
        Column (3) uses a fully-balanced panel that, starting from the baseline
        panel, drops all data before July 2015.
        Column (4) uses the baseline panel and reweights observations so that 
        the sample of ZIP codes in the data has the same averages that the set 
        of urban ZIP codes in the following variables:
        share of white population (census 2010), 
        share of African-American population (census 2010),
        share of renter-occupied households (census 2010),
        median household income (ACS 2011).
        The re-weigthing procedure follows \textcite{Hainmueller2012}.
