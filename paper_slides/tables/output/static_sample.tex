        Notes:
        Data are from Zillow \parencite{ZillowData}, 
        the statutory MW panel described in Section \ref{sec:mw_construction}, 
        LODES origin-destination statistics \parencite{CensusLODES},
        and the QCEW \parencite{QCEW}.
        Every column show the results of regressions of the log of 
        median rents per square foot on our MW-based measures.
        All regressions are estimated in first differences and include 
        time-period fixed effects and economic controls that vary at the 
        county and month levels.
        The measure of rents per square foot corresponds to the Single Family, 
        Condominium and Cooperative houses from Zillow.
        Columns (1) and (2) use our baseline sample defined in Section 
        \ref{sec:data_final_panel}.
        Column (3) and (4) use the unbalanced sample of all ZIP codes with 
        Zillow rents data at any point in time, and controls for year-quarter of 
        entry to the panel $\times$ year-month fixed effects.
        Even numbered columns re-weight observations so that the sample of 
        ZIP codes in the data matches the averages of the set of ZIP codes
        located in urban CBSAs in the following variables:
        share of renter-occupied households \parencite{CensusDecennial}, and share of 
        workers and share of residents that according to LODES 2013 earn less than 
        \$1251 \parencite{CensusLODES}.
        Weights for each sample are computed following \textcite{Hainmueller2012}.
        We define urban CBSAs as in the second column of Table 
        \ref{tab:stats_zip_samples}.
        Standard errors in parentheses are clustered at the state level.
