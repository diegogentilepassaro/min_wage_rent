        Notes:
        Commuting data are from LODES, and minimum wage 
        data are from the panel described in Section \ref{sec:mw_construction}.
        The table shows estimations of the effect of the workplace MW and
        residence MW on a ZIP code's composition of workers, using four different measures. Columns (1) and (2) show the effect on the share of residents and workers that work in the accommodation and food industry, while columns (3) and (4) show the estimated effect on the share of residents and workers that have an educational level lower than high school. 
        All regressions include economic controls, zipcode fixed effects, and CBSA by year fixed effects.
        The unit of observation is ZIP code by year.
        Standard errors in parentheses are clustered at the CBSA level.
