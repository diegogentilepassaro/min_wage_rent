        Notes: 
        Data are from the baseline estimation sample described in Section 
        \ref{sec:data_final_panel}.
        Both columns show the results of regressions of the log of 
        median rents per square foot on our MW-based measures.
        Column (1) repeats the results of Column (4) in Table \ref{tab:static}.
        Column (2) extends the estimate of Column (2) including the lagged 
        change in log rents as a control, and is estimated using an 
        instrumental-variables strategy that uses the second lag of rents
        as an instrument for the first lag following \textcite{ArellanoBond1991}.
        All regressions are estimated in first differences and include 
        time-period fixed effects and economic controls that vary at the 
        county and month levels.
        The measure of rents per square foot corresponds to the Single Family, 
        Condominium and Cooperative houses from Zillow.
        The residence MW is defined as the log statutory MW in the same ZIP code.
        The workplace MW is defined as the statutory MW where the average 
        resident of the ZIP code works, constructed using LODES 
        origin-destination data.
        Economic controls from the QCEW include the log of the average wage, 
        the log of employment, and the log of the establishment count from the 
        sectors ``Information'', ``Financial activities'', and ``Professional
        and business services''.
        Standard errors in parentheses are clustered at the state level.
