        Notes: 
        Data are from LODES \parencite{CensusLODES}, 
        Small Area Fair Market Rents \parencite{hudSAFMR},
        ZIP code aggregate statistics \parencite{IRS}, and
        the MW panel described in Section \ref{sec:data_mw_panel}.
        The table shows the median of the estimated ZIP-code specific shares of 
        the additional income pocketed by landlords (``Share pocketed''), 
        defined as the ratio of the increase in income to the increase in rents. 
        We also report the median change in residence MW, change in workplace MW,
        and share of ZIP-code specific housing expenditure 
        (``Share of housing exp.'') defined in Appendix 
        \ref{sec:measure_housing_expenditure}.
        Increases in income and rents are simulated following the procedure 
        described in Section \ref{sec:counterfactual}.
        Panel A assumes a 10\% increase in the federal MW, and
        Panel B assumes an increase in the federal MW to \$15.
        We assume the following parameter values:
        $\beta = \betaCf$, $\gamma = \gammaCf$, and $\varepsilon = \epsilonCf$.
        We carry out our computations only for urban ZIP codes, defined as 
        in Table \ref{tab:stats_zip_samples}.
        In the last row of each panel, we also report the total incidence of the 
        counterfactual policy as explained in Section \ref{sec:emp_cf}.
        The figure excludes ZIP codes located in CBAs for which the average
        estimated change in log total wages was below 0.1\% in the respective
        counterfactual scenario.
