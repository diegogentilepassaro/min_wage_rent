        Notes: 
        Data are from LODES and the minimum wage panel described in Section 
        \ref{sec:mw_construction}.
        The table shows averages of the estimated ZIP-code specific shares of the 
        additional income pocketed by landlords, defined as the ratio of the 
        increase in income to the increase in rents. Increases in income and rents are 
        simulated following the procedure described in Section \ref{sec:counterfactual}, 
        where we assume an increase in the federal MW to \$9.
        We also report the average share of ZIP-code specific housing expenditure, 
        defined as explained in XXXX.
        Panel A assumes a 10\% increase in the federal MW, and
        Panel B assumes an increase in the federal MW to \$15.
        We assume the following parameter values:
        $\beta = 0.0546$, $\gamma = -0.0207$, and $\varepsilon = 0.1083$.
        We carry out our computations only for urban ZIP codes, defined as 
        those that belong to a CBSA with at least 80\% of urban population
        according to the 2010 census.
        The figure excludes ZIP codes located in CBAs for which the average
        estimated change in log total wages was below 0.1\% in the respective
        counterfactual scenario.
