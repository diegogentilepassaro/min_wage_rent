        Notes: 
        Data are from the baseline estimation sample described in Section 
        \ref{sec:data_final_panel}.
        All columns show the results of regressions of the log of median rents 
        per square foot on the residence and workplace MW measures.
        Columns (1) and (2) estimate two-way fixed-effects regressions in 
        levels that include ZIP code and year-month fixed effects.
        Columns (3) and (4) estimate models in first differences that include 
        year-month fixed effects.
        All regressions include economic controls (in levels or first differences,
        respectively) that vary at the county by month and county by quarter levels.
        Odd-numbered columns are estimated under OLS.
        Even-numbered columns include the lagged variable of the dependent variable
        as control, and are estimated using an IV strategy where the first lag is 
        instrumented with the second lag, following \textcite{ArellanoBond1991}.
        The measure of rents per square foot corresponds to the SFCC category 
        from Zillow.
        The residence MW is defined as the log statutory MW in the same ZIP code.
        The workplace MW is defined as the statutory MW where the average 
        resident of the ZIP code works, constructed using LODES 
        origin-destination data.
        Economic controls from the QCEW include the log of the average wage, 
        the log of employment, and the log of the establishment count from the 
        sectors ``Information'', ``Financial activities'', and ``Professional
        and business services''.
        Standard errors in parentheses are clustered at the state level.
