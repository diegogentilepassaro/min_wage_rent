        Notes:
        We display estimates of $\rho$ for $s_i = 0.35$ computed  as explained in 
        \ref{sec:rho} for each decile of $\Delta \MW_i^{wrk} - \Delta \MW_i^{res}$. 
        Computations were done using rents and total wages predictions as described 
        in \ref{sec:cf_rents_and_wage_changes}.
