        Notes: 
        Data are from the \textcite{IRS} and the \textcite{hudSAFMR}.
        The figure shows the ratio between wage per household divided by twelve
        and the SAFMR 40th percentile rent value for a 2-bedroom apartment, both
        for 2018.
        We carry out our computations only for urban ZIP codes, defined as 
        those that belong to a CBSA with at least 80\% of urban population
        according to the 2010 census.
