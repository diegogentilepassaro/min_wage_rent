        Notes:
        Data are from LODES and the MW panel described in Section
        \ref{sec:data_mw_panel}.
        The figures show the distribution of changes in the residence and 
        workplace MW measures generated by a counterfactual increase to \$9 
        in the federal MW in January 2020, holding constant other MW policies 
        in their December 2019 levels.
        The unit of observation is the urban ZIP code, where we define a ZIP code 
        as urban if it belongs to a CBSA with at least 80\% of its population 
        classified as urban by the 2010 Census.
