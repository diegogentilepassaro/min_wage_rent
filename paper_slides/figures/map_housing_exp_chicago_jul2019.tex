        The figure shows housing expenditure shares as computed in
        Online Appendix \ref{sec:measure_housing_expenditure}, namely,
        by dividing the SAFMR 40th percentile rental value for a 2-bedroom 
        apartment by average monthly wage per household divided, both
        for 2018.
        We include ZIP codes located in the Chicago-Naperville-Elgin CBSA.
