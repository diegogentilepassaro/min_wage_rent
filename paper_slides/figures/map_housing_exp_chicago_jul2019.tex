        Notes:
        The figure shows housing expenditure shares as computed in
        Section \ref{sec:measure_housing_expenditure}. Specifically,
        this is ratio between wage per household divided by twelve
        and the SAFMR 40th percentile rent value for a 2-bedroom apartment, both
        for 2018. Data are from the \textcite{IRS} and the \textcite{hudSAFMR}.
        We include ZIP codes located in the metropolitan area of Chicago.
