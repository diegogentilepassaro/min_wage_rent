    %%  SH: This figure (and folder in general) needs a review. 
    %%      - Format should be dps
    %%      - Legend should fit better, and change 'zillow' --> 'Zillow'
    %%      - We should drop figures we don't need

        Notes:
        Data are from \textcite{ZillowData} and Small Area Fair Market Rents 
        (\citeyear[SAFMR]{hudSAFMR}).
        The figure compares the evolution of the median rental value in Zillow
        to three SAFMRs series, for 2, 3, and 4 or more bedrooms.
