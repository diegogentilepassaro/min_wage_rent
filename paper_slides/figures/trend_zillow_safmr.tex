        Notes:
        Data are from \textcite{ZillowData} and Small Area Fair Market Rents 
        (\citeyear[SAFMR]{hudSAFMR}).
        The figure compares the evolution of the median rental value in Zillow
        to three SAFMRs series, for 2, 3, and 4 or more bedrooms.
        SAFMR data generally corresponds to the 40th percentile of the
        distribution of paid rents in a given ZIP code.
        For more information on how SAFMRs are calculated, see 
        \textcite[][page 41641]{hudPreamble}.
