        Notes: Data are from the 2011 and 2013 American Housing Surveys.
        The figure shows the probability of a household living in a
        rented unit by household income. 
        We construct the figure as follows.
        First, we residualize an indicator for being a renter and 
        household income by SMSA indicators, the closest analogue of CBSAs 
        available in the data.
        Second, we construct deciles of the residualized household
        income variable.
        Finally, we take the average of the residualized renter 
        indicator within each decile.
        We exclude from the calculation non-conventional housing units, 
        such as mobile homes, hotels, and others.
