        Notes: Data are from the 2011 and 2013 American Housing 
        Survey (AHS), as described in Section \ref{ADD SECTION}. 
        The figure shows the distribution of the probability of 
        renting by household income. 
        Both the probability of being a renter and the household income
        are residualized at the SMSA level.
        We exclude from the calculation non-conventional housing units, 
        such as mobile homes, hotels, rooming houses, etc.
