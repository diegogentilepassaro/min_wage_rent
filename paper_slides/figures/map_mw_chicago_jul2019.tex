        Notes: 
        Data are from the MW panel described in
        Section \ref{sec:data_mw_panel} and from LODES.
        The figures show changes in the MW measures in July 2019 in the 
        metropolitan area of Chicago.
        The figure on the left shows the change in the residence MW.
        The figure on the right shows the change in the workplace MW. 
        The residence MW is defined as the log of the statutory MW of the given
        ZIP code.
        The workplace MW is defined as the weighted average of the log of the
        statutory MW levels in workplace locations of a ZIP code's residents,
        where weights are given by commuting shares.
