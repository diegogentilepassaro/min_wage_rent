        Notes: 
        Data are from the minimum wage panel described in 
        Section \ref{sec:mw_construction} and from LODES.
        The top figures show the distribution of the estimated ZIP-code specific
        shares of the additional income pocketed by landlords (``share pocketed''),
        the bottom left figure maps estimated changes in log rents, and 
        the bottom right figure maps estimated changes in log total wages,
        for ZIP codes in the Chicago-Naperville-Elgin CBSA.
        The computations are based on a counterfactual increase to \$9 in the 
        federal MW in January 2020, holding constant other MW policies in their 
        December 2019 levels.
        The share pocketed is defined as the ratio between the percent increase 
        in rents and the percent increase in total wages multiplied by the share 
        of housing expenditure in the ZIP code.
        To estimate it we follow the procedure described in Section 
        \ref{sec:counterfactual}, assuming the following parameter values: 
        $\beta = 0.0546$, $\gamma = -0.0207$, $\varepsilon = 0.1083$, and 
        $s = 0.35$.
