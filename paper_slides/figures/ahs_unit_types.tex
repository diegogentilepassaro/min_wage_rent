        Notes: Data are from the 2011 and 2013 American Housing Surveys.
        The top figure shows the number of housing units in the building where 
        the household is located, and the bottom figure shows the share of 
        housing units located in condominiums or cooperative housing, both by 
        household income.
        We construct the figure as follows.
        First, we residualize the variable in the y-axis and household income 
        by SMSA indicators, the closest analogue of CBSAs available in the data.
        Second, we construct deciles of the residualized household income 
        variable.
        Finally, we take the average of the residualized y-variable within each 
        decile.
        We exclude from the calculation non-conventional housing units, such as 
        mobile homes, hotels, and others.
