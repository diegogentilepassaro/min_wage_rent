        Notes: 
        Data are from the baseline estimation sample.
        The measure of rents per square foot corresponds to the Single Family, 
        Condominium and Cooperative houses from Zillow.
        Let $\text{st}$ denote the model with state by year-month fixed effects,
        and $\text{base}$ the baseline model.
        Then, the first row tests the null $\beta^{\text{st}} - \beta^{\text{base}} = 0$,
        whereas the second row tests the null $\gamma^{\text{st}} - \gamma^{\text{base}} = 0$.
        All regressions include economic controls from the QCEW.
        Standard errors in parentheses are clustered at the state level.
