        Notes: The table shows estimates of the stacked model under different balancing
        periods $w$.
        To construct the samples we proceed as follows. First, we identify all ZIP code months
        that have a change in the binding MW. Then, we call a CBSA-month as treated if in 
        that month has at least one ZIP code that had a change in the binding MW. For each 
        of the treated CBSA-months we assign a unique event ID. For each event, we take a 
        window $w$, and we keep all months within that window for the ZIP codes that are within
        the treated CBSA. If a ZIP code has missing data for some month within the window, 
        we drop the entire ZIP code.
