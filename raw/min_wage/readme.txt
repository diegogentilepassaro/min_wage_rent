OVERVIEW
========================================================
This directory contains data on minimum wage changes in the US.


SOURCE
========================================================
VZ_*.xlsx files were obtained by Gabriele Borg from the paper Vaghul 
& Zipperer (2016) in February 2020. See github repo of the authors:
https://github.com/equitablegrowth/VZ_historicalminwage/releases

UCB-Labor-Center-city-min-wage-inventory.xlsx was downloaded by Santiago
Hermo in March 2020 from:
http://laborcenter.berkeley.edu/minimum-wage-living-wage-resources/inventory-of-us-city-and-county-minimum-wage-ordinances/


NOTES
========================================================
Files VZ_*.xlsx are used to construct the dataset. They contain MW changes up to 2016 from
Vaghul & Zipperer (2016). They were updated manually with 2017-2020 MW increases at the
state and substate level from the file UCB-Labor-Center-city-min-wage-inventory.xlsx and
Google searches. See issue #7 and PR #20 for details.
